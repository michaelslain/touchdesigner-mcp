# Render Pass TOP

**Family:** TOP (Texture Operator)

## Summary

The Render Pass TOP is used along with a Render TOP to achieve multipass rendering. It can build upon its inputs render by using the existing depth/color information in the framebuffers, or it can optionally clear one or both of the depth/color buffers before it does its render.

## Parameters

### Render Pass Page

#### Render/RenderPass TOP `renderinput`

The network path to the Render TOP used as input. This parameter can be used as an alternate to connecting a Render or Render Pass TOP to the Render Pass's input connector. Makes it easier to select a render from another network.

#### Camera `camera`

Specifies which Cameras to look through when rendering the scene.

#### Geometry `geometry`

Specifies which Geometry will be included in the rendered scene. You can use Pattern Matching to specify objects using patterns. Example: geo* ^geo7 will render all Geometry components whose names start with geo except geo7.

#### Lights `lights`

Specifies which Lights will be used to render the scene. You can use Pattern Matching here as well.

#### Clear to Camera Color `cleartocamcolor`

Clears the values that are currently in the color buffer (coming from the TOP that is wired to the input of this node).

#### Clear Depth Buffer `cleardepth`

Clears the values that are currently in the depth buffer (coming from the TOP that is wired to the input of this node).

#### Positive Sides `posside`

When Render Mode is Cube Map, specify which sides if the cube map are rendered, +X, +Y, or +Z.

- **Positive Sides** `possidex`
- **Positive Sides** `possidey`
- **Positive Sides** `possidez`

#### Negative Sides `negside`

When Render Mode is Cube Map, specify which sides if the cube map are rendered, -X, -Y, or -Z.

- **Negative Sides** `negsidex`
- **Negative Sides** `negsidey`
- **Negative Sides** `negsidez`

#### Transparency `transparency`

Refer to to the same parameter in the Render TOPs help page.

- **Sorted Draw with Blending** `sortedblending`
- **Order Independent Transparency** `orderind`
- **Alpha-to-Coverage** `alphatocoverage`

#### Depth Peel `depthpeel`

Refer to to the same parameter in the Render TOPs help page.

#### Transparency/Peel Layers `transpeellayers`

Refer to to the same parameter in the Render TOPs help page.

### Advanced Page

#### Render `render`

Enables rendering; 1 = on, 0 = off.

#### Dither `dither`

Dithers the rendering to help deal with banding and other artifacts created by precision limitations of 8-bit displays.

#### Color Output Needed `coloroutputneeded`

This is an optimization if you don't actually need the color result from this pass. Turning this off avoids a copy from the offscreen render buffer to the TOP's texture. When anti-aliasing is enabled turning this off will also avoid 'resolving' the anti-aliasing.

#### Draw Depth Only `drawdepthonly`

This will cause the render to only draw depth values to the depth buffer. No color values will be created. To make use of the depth buffer, use the Depth TOP.

#### Allow Blending for Extra Buffers `allowbufblending`

Controls if blending (as enabled by the MAT common page setting) will be enabled for extra buffers beyond the first one. Often the extra buffers are used to write other types of information such as normals or positions, where blending wouldn't be desirable.

- **Off** `off`
- **On** `on`
- **Use Input Setting** `useinput`

#### Cull Face `cullface`

Front Faces, Back Faces, Both Faces, Neither. Will cause the render to avoid rendering certain polygon faces depending on their orientation to the camera. Refer to Back-Face Culling for more information.

- **Neither** `neither`
- **Back Faces** `backfaces`
- **Front Faces** `frontfaces`
- **Both Faces** `bothfaces`

#### Override Material `overridemat`

This allows you to specific a material that will be applied to every Geometry that is rendered in the Render TOP. It is useful for pre-processing passes where we are outputting infoformation about the geometry rather then lighting them and outputting RGB.

#### Polygon Depth Offset `polygonoffset`

This feature pushes the polygons back into space a tiny fraction. This is useful when you are rendering two polygons directly ontop of each other and are experiencing Z-Fighting. Refer to Polygon Depth Offset for more information. This is also an important feature when doing shadows.

#### Offset Factor `polygonoffsetfactor`

Refer to to the same parameter in the Render TOPs help page.

#### Offset Units `polygonoffsetunits`

Refer to to the same parameter in the Render TOPs help page.

#### Display Overdraw `overdraw`

This feature visually shows the overdraw in the scene. Refer to the Early Depth-Test article for more information. In particular the Analyzing Overdraw section.

#### Overdraw Limit `overdrawlimit`

This value quantizes the outputted color value to some # of overdraws. Refer to the Early Depth-Test for more information.

### Common Page

#### Output Resolution `outputresolution`

quickly change the resolution of the TOP's data.

- **Use Input** `useinput` - Uses the input's resolution.
- **Eighth** `eighth` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
- **Quarter** `quarter` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
- **Half** `half` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
- **2X** `2x` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
- **4X** `4x` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
- **8X** `8x` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
- **Fit Resolution** `fit` - Fits the width and height to the resolution given below, while maintaining the aspect ratio.
- **Limit Resolution** `limit` - The width and height are limited to the resolution given below. If one of the dimensions exceeds the given resolution, the width and height will be reduced to fit inside the given limits while maintaining the aspect ratio.
- **Custom Resolution** `custom` - Enables the Resolution parameter below, giving direct control over width and height.

#### Resolution `resolution`

Enabled only when the Resolution parameter is set to Custom Resolution. Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions.

- **W** `resolutionw`
- **H** `resolutionh`

#### Resolution Menu `resmenu`

A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions.

#### Use Global Res Multiplier `resmult`

Uses the Global Resolution Multiplier found in Edit>Preferences>TOPs. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global Resolution Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this TOP is affected by the global multiplier.

#### Output Aspect `outputaspect`

Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)

- **Use Input** `useinput` - Uses the input's aspect ratio.
- **Resolution** `resolution` - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square.
- **Custom Aspect** `custom` - Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.

#### Aspect `aspect`

Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect.

- **Aspect1** `aspect1`
- **Aspect2** `aspect2`

#### Aspect Menu `armenu`

A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios.

#### Input Smoothness `inputfiltertype`

This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the TOP.

- **Nearest Pixel** `nearest` - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native Resolution.
- **Interpolate Pixels** `linear` - Uses linear filtering between pixels. This is how you get TOP images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native Resolution.
- **Mipmap Pixels** `mipmap` - Uses mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.

#### Fill Viewer `fillmode`

Determine how the TOP image is displayed in the viewer. NOTE:To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to Native Resolution as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.

- **Use Input** `useinput` - Uses the same Fill Viewer settings as it's input.
- **Fill** `fill` - Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer.
- **Fit Horizontal** `width` - Stretches image to fit viewer horizontally.
- **Fit Vertical** `height` - Stretches image to fit viewer vertically.
- **Fit Best** `best` - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped.
- **Fit Outside** `outside` - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer.
- **Native Resolution** `nativeres` - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.

#### Viewer Smoothness `filtertype`

This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.

- **Nearest Pixel** `nearest` - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native Resolution.
- **Interpolate Pixels** `linear` - Uses linear filtering between pixels. Use this to get TOP images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native Resolution.
- **Mipmap Pixels** `mipmap` - Uses mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.

#### Passes `npasses`

Duplicates the operation of the TOP the specified number of times. Making this larger than 1 is essentially the same as taking the output from each pass, and passing it into the first input of the node and repeating the process. Other inputs and parameters remain the same for each pass.

#### Channel Mask `chanmask`

Allows you to choose which channels (R, G, B, or A) the TOP will operate on. All channels are selected by default.
