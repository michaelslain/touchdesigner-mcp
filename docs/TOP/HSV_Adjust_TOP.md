# HSV Adjust TOP

**Family:** TOP (Texture Operator)

## Summary

The HSV Adjust TOP adjust color values using hue, saturation, and value controls. If you change the Hue Offset, Saturation Multiplier and Value Multiplier without changing any of the other parameters then you will modify the color of all pixels in the image. The other parameters are used to narrow the range of pixels you want to modify based on their hue, saturation and value. For example if you leave the Hue Range untouched but reduce the saturation range, you will cause the TOP to modify only pixels who fall into the new saturation range. The range is the Start Color's saturation + the Range + the Falloff, in this example.

> **Note:** This TOP supports 3D Textures and 2D Texture Arrays.

## Parameters

### HSV Tweak Page

#### Start Color `startcolor`

The start color is the hue that the HSV adjustment is centered around. When adjusting a small hue range, this is the color that will be altered. In the example image above, the Start Color color is cyan with a hue value of 180.

- **Red** `startcolorr`
- **Green** `startcolorg`
- **Blue** `startcolorb`

#### Hue Range `huerange`

This is the range of color from the Start Color that will be adjusted. A range of 1 will only adjust the colors that are the same as the start color. A range of 360 will adjust all colors. For example, a range of 20 and a Start Color of 180 will adjust colors in the hue range of 170-190.

#### Hue Falloff `huefalloff`

This controls the falloff from the Hue Range. Higher values give more falloff, blending the hue range softly from hues that are adjusted to hues that are not.

#### Saturation Range `saturationrange`

This is the range of saturation to adjust from the saturation of the Start Color. The Range is from 0 to 1.

#### Saturation Falloff `saturationfalloff`

This controls the falloff from the Saturation Range selected.

#### Value Range `valuerange`

This is the range of value to adjust from the value of the Start Color. The Range is from 0 to 1.

#### Value Falloff `valuefalloff`

This controls the falloff from the Value Range selected.

#### Hue Offset `hueoffset`

Adjust the hues selected above. The Hue Offset ranges from 0 to 360. For example, if the initial pixel color is 180 then a Hue Offset of 100 will change the hue of 180 (cyan) to be a hue of 280 (violet).

#### Saturation Multiplier `saturationmult`

Adjusts the saturations selected above. This will multiply the saturation values specified by Saturation Range and Falloff parameters above. Setting this to 0 will reduce the selected saturation to 0, setting it to 1 will maintain the current saturation values, and setting it to 2 will make the selected saturation twice as saturated.

#### Value Multiplier `valuemult`

Adjusts the values selected above. This will multiply the values specified by Value Range and Falloff parameters above.

### Common Page

#### Output Resolution `outputresolution`

quickly change the resolution of the TOP's data.

- **Use Input** `useinput` - Uses the input's resolution.
- **Eighth** `eighth` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
- **Quarter** `quarter` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
- **Half** `half` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
- **2X** `2x` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
- **4X** `4x` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
- **8X** `8x` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
- **Fit Resolution** `fit` - Fits the width and height to the resolution given below, while maintaining the aspect ratio.
- **Limit Resolution** `limit` - The width and height are limited to the resolution given below. If one of the dimensions exceeds the given resolution, the width and height will be reduced to fit inside the given limits while maintaining the aspect ratio.
- **Custom Resolution** `custom` - Enables the Resolution parameter below, giving direct control over width and height.

#### Resolution `resolution`

Enabled only when the Resolution parameter is set to Custom Resolution. Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions.

- **W** `resolutionw`
- **H** `resolutionh`

#### Resolution Menu `resmenu`

A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions.

#### Use Global Res Multiplier `resmult`

Uses the Global Resolution Multiplier found in Edit>Preferences>TOPs. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global Resolution Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this TOP is affected by the global multiplier.

#### Output Aspect `outputaspect`

Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)

- **Use Input** `useinput` - Uses the input's aspect ratio.
- **Resolution** `resolution` - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square.
- **Custom Aspect** `custom` - Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.

#### Aspect `aspect`

Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect.

- **Aspect1** `aspect1`
- **Aspect2** `aspect2`

#### Aspect Menu `armenu`

A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios.

#### Input Smoothness `inputfiltertype`

This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the TOP.

- **Nearest Pixel** `nearest` - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native Resolution.
- **Interpolate Pixels** `linear` - Uses linear filtering between pixels. This is how you get TOP images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native Resolution.
- **Mipmap Pixels** `mipmap` - Uses mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.

#### Fill Viewer `fillmode`

Determine how the TOP image is displayed in the viewer. NOTE:To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to Native Resolution as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.

- **Use Input** `useinput` - Uses the same Fill Viewer settings as it's input.
- **Fill** `fill` - Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer.
- **Fit Horizontal** `width` - Stretches image to fit viewer horizontally.
- **Fit Vertical** `height` - Stretches image to fit viewer vertically.
- **Fit Best** `best` - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped.
- **Fit Outside** `outside` - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer.
- **Native Resolution** `nativeres` - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.

#### Viewer Smoothness `filtertype`

This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.

- **Nearest Pixel** `nearest` - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native Resolution.
- **Interpolate Pixels** `linear` - Uses linear filtering between pixels. Use this to get TOP images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native Resolution.
- **Mipmap Pixels** `mipmap` - Uses mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.

#### Passes `npasses`

Duplicates the operation of the TOP the specified number of times. Making this larger than 1 is essentially the same as taking the output from each pass, and passing it into the first input of the node and repeating the process. Other inputs and parameters remain the same for each pass.

#### Parameter Color Space `parmcolorspace`

Controls how all color parameters on this node are interpreted. The color values as treated as being in the selected color space, and are converted to the Working Color Space before they are used as part of the node's operation. Note that this does not change the color space of the node itself, as that is always in the Working Color Space.

- **sRGB** `srgb` - sRGB color space, with sRGB transfer function. Considered an SDR color space with respect to Reference White.
- **sRGB - Linear** `srgblinear` - sRGB color space, with linear transfer function. Considered an SDR color space with respect to Reference White.
- **Rec.601 (NTSC)** `rec601ntsc` - Rec.601 with NTSC primaries color space, with Rec.601 transfer function. Considered an SDR color space with respect to Reference White.
- **Rec.709** `rec709` - Rec.709 color space, with Rec.709 (same as Rec.2020) transfer function. Considered an SDR color space with respect to Reference White.
- **Rec.2020** `rec2020` - Rec.2020 color space, with Rec.2020 (same as Rec.709) transfer function. Considered an HDR color space with respect to Reference White.

- **Passthrough** `passthrough` - When selected, the color values will be used as-is in the operation, without any modification or attempt to convert them into the Working Color Space.

#### Parameter Reference White `parmreferencewhite`

When converting a parameter color value to the Working Color Space, this controls how it should be treated with respect to Reference White. If the Working Color Space is the same Reference White, then no adjustment is done. If they are different, then the Reference White level (brightness) of this color will be adjusted to the range expected by the Working Color Space. For example if the project is set to have a SDR Reference White of 120 nits, and the HDR Reference White is 80 nits, then a color of (1, 1, 1), which is 120 nits in the SDR color space, will be converted to be (1.5, 1.5, 1.5), which is 120 nits still in the HDR Working Color Space.

- **Default For Color Space** `default` - Will use either the SDR or the HDR Reference White, based on the color space selected.
- **Use Parent Panel** `useparent` - Will use the Reference White that the parent panel has selected. If the top-level panel also has 'Use Parent' selected, then 'UI Reference White' will be used.
- **Standard (SDR)** `sdr` - Will treat the Parameter Color Space as SDR for it's reference white value.
- **High (HDR)** `hdr` - Will treat the Parameter Color Space as HDR for it's reference white value.
- **UI** `ui` - Will treat the Parameter Color Space as UI for it's reference white value. This uses the 'UI Reference White Nits' value for it's brightness.
