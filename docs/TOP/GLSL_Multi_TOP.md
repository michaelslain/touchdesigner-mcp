# GLSL Multi TOP

**Family:** TOP (Texture Operator)

## Summary

The GLSL Multi TOP renders a GLSL shader into a TOP image. Its parameters and functionality are identical to the GLSL TOP, except it allows for more than 3 inputs.Refer to the GLSL TOP help page for more information.

## Parameters

### GLSL Page

#### GLSL Version `glslversion`

Pick what version of GLSL to compile the shader with.

#### Mode `mode`

Choose what type of shader you are writing, vertex/pixel shader, or a compute shader.

- **Vertex/Pixel Shader** `vertexpixel`
- **Compute Shader** `compute`

#### Preprocess Directives `predat`

#### Vertex Shader `vertexdat`

Points to the DAT holding the Vertex Shader. Drag & Drop a DAT here, or manually enter the path to the DAT.

#### Pixel Shader `pixeldat`

Points to the DAT holding the Pixel Shader. Drag & Drop a DAT here, or manually enter the path to the DAT.

#### Compute Shader `computedat`

Points to the DAT holding the Compute Shader. Drag & Drop a DAT here, or manually enter the path to the DAT.

#### Load Uniform Names `loaduniformnames`

When this button is pressed the node will try to pre-fill all it's uniform parameter with uniforms that are declare in the shader. Note that the shader compiler will likely not expose uniforms that are unused.

#### Auto Dispatch Size `autodispatchsize`

Automatically set the dispatch size based on the compute shader's local size and the output texture resolution. Ensures at least one thread per pixel will execute.

#### Dispatch Size `dispatchsize`

The dispatch size to use when executing a compute shader.

- **X** `dispatchsizex`
- **Y** `dispatchsizey`
- **Z** `dispatchsizez`

#### Output Access `outputaccess`

Controls how the output textures will be accessed. If the textures will be read from (such as using previous frame's values), then the access should be changed to Read-Write instead of Write Only.

- **Write Only** `writeonly`
- **Read Only** `readonly`
- **Read-Write** `readwrite`

#### Output Type `type`

Specify what type of texture to create. When creating a 3D texture the TOP will render once for every slice of the output. Refer to 3D Textures and 2D Texture Arrays for more info.

- **2D Texture** `texture2d` - Creates a 2D texture.
- **2D Texture Array** `texture2darray` - Creates a 2D Texture Array. Slices of the array can be access using a non-normalized integer index for the w coordinate.
- **3D Texture** `texture3d` - Creates a 3D Texture. Slices of the array can be accessed using the w coordinate in the range 0-1. Value of the texture in between slices are interpolated.

#### Depth `depth`

Set the depth of the 3D texture from the Input or the Custom Depth parameter.

- **Input** `input`
- **Custom** `custom`

#### Custom Depth `customdepth`

Manually set the depth of the 3D texture, otherwise it will use the depth of the input.

#### Clear Outputs `clearoutputs`

#### Clear Value `clearvalue`

- **Clear Value** `clearvaluer`
- **Clear Value** `clearvalueg`
- **Clear Value** `clearvalueb`
- **Clear Value** `clearvaluea`

#### Input Mapping `inputmapping`

Determines how the node's input(s) are passed into the shader for use when creating a 3D Texture. By default all of the inputs are passed to each slice. When using the N inputs per Slice mode, the first N inputs are passed to the first slice, the next N inputs are passed the second slice, and so on. When it runs out of inputs it loops back to the first input. N is selected by the parameter N Value.

- **All Inputs to Every Slice** `all`
- **N Input(s) per Slice** `ninputs`

#### N Value `nval`

Determines how many inputs are passed to the shader per slice when using the N inputs per Slice mode for Input Mapping. If for example this is set to 2, then the first 2 inputs will be passed to the first slice, the next 2 inputs will be passed the second slice, and so on. It will loop back to the start of the inputs if it runs out before it reaches the last slice.

#### Input Extend Mode UV `inputextenduv`

Controls what is returned from your texture sampling functions when the U and V texture coordinates (called S and T in the shader) are outside [0-1] range.

- **Hold** `hold`
- **Zero** `zero`
- **Repeat** `repeat`
- **Mirror** `mirror`

#### Input Extend Mode W `inputextendw`

Controls what is returned from your texture sampling functions when the W texture coordinate (called W in the shader) are outside [0-1] range. Only useful for 3D Texture.

- **Hold** `hold`
- **Zero** `zero`
- **Repeat** `repeat`
- **Mirror** `mirror`

#### # of Color Buffers `numcolorbufs`

Any shader you write can output to more than one RGBA buffer at a time. Turn up this value to have more color buffers allocated for you, and refer to [Write_a_GLSL_TOP#Outputting_to_Multiple_Color_Buffers Write a GLSL TOP] for more information on using this feature.

### Vectors Page

#### Vector `vec`

Sequence of vector uniforms Name vec0name - The uniform name, as declared in the shader Value vec0value - ⊞ - The value(s) to give the uniform.

- **Value** `vec0valuex`
- **Value** `vec0valuey`
- **Value** `vec0valuez`
- **Value** `vec0valuew`

### Arrays Page

#### Array `array`

Sequence of array uniforms Name array0name - The name of the uniform. You can send up to 4 channels into the GLSL shader in a single uniform. The number of channels is determined by the float/vec2/vec3/vec4 menu to the right of the name. For a CHOP with a single channel declare your uniform as a float, for one with two channels declare your uniform as a vec2, etc. The data is interleaved in the uniform. I.e the .x component is the 1st channel, .y is the 2nd channel, etc. Type array0type - ⊞ - The data type of the uniform in the shader. CHOP array0chop - The channels from this CHOP will be sent to the GLSL shader. Array Type array0arraytype - ⊞ - The type of the uniform.

- **float** `float`
- **vec2** `vec2`
- **vec3** `vec3`
- **vec4** `vec4`
- **Uniform Array** `uniformarray` - All GPUs can send array data into a GLSL shader using Uniform Arrays.
- **Texture Buffer** `texturebuffer` - Newer GPUs can send array data into a GLSL shader using Texture Buffers. Texture Buffers use texture memory and texture fetches to access the data, which allows them to store many more values.

### Matrices Page

#### Matrix `matrix`

Sequence of matrix uniforms Name matrix0name - The name of the matrix uniform. Matrix matrix0value - The value to assign the matrix. For valid ways to specify this, see the Matrix Parameters article.

### Atomic Counters Page

#### Atomic Counter `ac`

Sequence of atomic counter uniforms Name ac0name - The name of the uniform. Initial Value Type ac0initvalue - ⊞ - Specifies how the atomic counters receive their initial value, either through a single default value or a CHOP. Initial Value ac0singlevalue - Specifies a single value that all atomic counters in this binding will be initialized to. Initial Values CHOP ac0chopvalue - A reference to the CHOP that will determine the initial values of the atomic counters in this binding. The CHOP will be spanned in track order, so the values from the first track will be read in order first, then the next track (if there is one) and so on. If there are more initial values to fill than there are values in the CHOP then they will all be set to 0. Atomic counters will be initialized from low to high offsets.

- **Single Value** `val`
- **CHOP Values** `chop`

### Constants Page

#### Constant `const`

Sequence of constant uniforms Name const0name - The constant name, as declared in the shader. Value const0value - The value to give the constant.

### Common Page

#### Output Resolution `outputresolution`

quickly change the resolution of the TOP's data.

- **Use Input** `useinput` - Uses the input's resolution.
- **Eighth** `eighth` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
- **Quarter** `quarter` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
- **Half** `half` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
- **2X** `2x` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
- **4X** `4x` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
- **8X** `8x` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
- **Fit Resolution** `fit` - Fits the width and height to the resolution given below, while maintaining the aspect ratio.
- **Limit Resolution** `limit` - The width and height are limited to the resolution given below. If one of the dimensions exceeds the given resolution, the width and height will be reduced to fit inside the given limits while maintaining the aspect ratio.
- **Custom Resolution** `custom` - Enables the Resolution parameter below, giving direct control over width and height.

#### Resolution `resolution`

Enabled only when the Resolution parameter is set to Custom Resolution. Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions.

- **W** `resolutionw`
- **H** `resolutionh`

#### Resolution Menu `resmenu`

A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions.

#### Use Global Res Multiplier `resmult`

Uses the Global Resolution Multiplier found in Edit>Preferences>TOPs. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global Resolution Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this TOP is affected by the global multiplier.

#### Output Aspect `outputaspect`

Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)

- **Use Input** `useinput` - Uses the input's aspect ratio.
- **Resolution** `resolution` - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square.
- **Custom Aspect** `custom` - Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.

#### Aspect `aspect`

Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect.

- **Aspect1** `aspect1`
- **Aspect2** `aspect2`

#### Aspect Menu `armenu`

A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios.

#### Input Smoothness `inputfiltertype`

This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the TOP.

- **Nearest Pixel** `nearest` - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native Resolution.
- **Interpolate Pixels** `linear` - Uses linear filtering between pixels. This is how you get TOP images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native Resolution.
- **Mipmap Pixels** `mipmap` - Uses mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.

#### Fill Viewer `fillmode`

Determine how the TOP image is displayed in the viewer. NOTE:To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to Native Resolution as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.

- **Use Input** `useinput` - Uses the same Fill Viewer settings as it's input.
- **Fill** `fill` - Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer.
- **Fit Horizontal** `width` - Stretches image to fit viewer horizontally.
- **Fit Vertical** `height` - Stretches image to fit viewer vertically.
- **Fit Best** `best` - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped.
- **Fit Outside** `outside` - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer.
- **Native Resolution** `nativeres` - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.

#### Viewer Smoothness `filtertype`

This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.

- **Nearest Pixel** `nearest` - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native Resolution.
- **Interpolate Pixels** `linear` - Uses linear filtering between pixels. Use this to get TOP images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native Resolution.
- **Mipmap Pixels** `mipmap` - Uses mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.

#### Passes `npasses`

Duplicates the operation of the TOP the specified number of times. Making this larger than 1 is essentially the same as taking the output from each pass, and passing it into the first input of the node and repeating the process. Other inputs and parameters remain the same for each pass.

#### Channel Mask `chanmask`

Allows you to choose which channels (R, G, B, or A) the TOP will operate on. All channels are selected by default.

#### Parameter Color Space `parmcolorspace`

Controls how all color parameters on this node are interpreted. The color values as treated as being in the selected color space, and are converted to the Working Color Space before they are used as part of the node's operation. Note that this does not change the color space of the node itself, as that is always in the Working Color Space.

- **sRGB** `srgb` - sRGB color space, with sRGB transfer function. Considered an SDR color space with respect to Reference White.
- **sRGB - Linear** `srgblinear` - sRGB color space, with linear transfer function. Considered an SDR color space with respect to Reference White.

- **Passthrough** `passthrough` - When selected, the color values will be used as-is in the operation, without any modification or attempt to convert them into the Working Color Space.

#### Parameter Reference White `parmreferencewhite`

When converting a parameter color value to the Working Color Space, this controls how it should be treated with respect to Reference White. If the Working Color Space is the same Reference White, then no adjustment is done. If they are different, then the Reference White level (brightness) of this color will be adjusted to the range expected by the Working Color Space. For example if the project is set to have a SDR Reference White of 120 nits, and the HDR Reference White is 80 nits, then a color of (1, 1, 1), which is 120 nits in the SDR color space, will be converted to be (1.5, 1.5, 1.5), which is 120 nits still in the HDR Working Color Space.

- **Default For Color Space** `default` - Will use either the SDR or the HDR Reference White, based on the color space selected.
- **Use Parent Panel** `useparent` - Will use the Reference White that the parent panel has selected. If the top-level panel also has 'Use Parent' selected, then 'UI Reference White' will be used.
- **Standard (SDR)** `sdr` - Will treat the Parameter Color Space as SDR for it's reference white value.
- **High (HDR)** `hdr` - Will treat the Parameter Color Space as HDR for it's reference white value.
- **UI** `ui` - Will treat the Parameter Color Space as UI for it's reference white value. This uses the 'UI Reference White Nits' value for it's brightness.
