# Movie File Out TOP

**Family:** TOP (Texture Operator)

## Summary

The Movie File Out TOP saves a TOP stream out to a movie file (.mov/.mp4) using a variety of codecs, including the H.264/H.265, Hap Q, NotchLC, Apple ProRes and Animation video codecs. It can also save single frame images, image sequences, or stop-frame movies.

For codecs that support Alpha, use the 'Movie Pixel Format' parameter to select a format that includes alpha.

The Export Movie Dialog is a user interface built around the Movie File Out TOP.

To record movies with audio using the Movie File Out TOP, a Time Sliced CHOP with mono or stereo channels of audio is required. If TouchDesigner is running at a lower frame rate than the target video frame rate and a CHOP is specified for audio, the Movie File Out TOP will automatically repeat video frames to ensure the video and audio stay in sync.

Recording a movie without frame drops can be done in non-realtime by turning off the Realtime flag at the top of the user interface. The length of the video is not predetermined and depends on the amount of time the Record parameter is on.

You can record a sequence of .tif or .exr files by setting the Type parameter to Image Sequence. When Image File Type is set to OpenEXR, the EXR page has options to record any number of color channels from multiple TOPs into an EXR image file, and can create it with metadata that would get read by a Point File In TOP.

The audio codecs that can be written out to file are ALAC (Apple Lossless), MP3, AAC, Vorbis, Opus, Uncompressed 16/32/64-bit (PCM).

H264/H265/AV1 NOTE: Encoding movies in H.264/H.265/AV1 codec is only available with a Commercial or Pro license. NVIDIA graphic hardware is also required on Windows. On macoOS H264 is supported.

Recording still images and stop-frame animation can be done by changing the 'Type' parameter. Then the 'Add Frame' pulse button can be pulsed manually or via a script to cause the frames to be written.

- **YUV 4:2:2** `yuv422`

#### Output Color Space `outputcolorspace`

Controls what color space the data will be converted to before output. If the output (file/SDI/ST2110 etc) supports metadata, will also attempt to include the color space in that. Some output forms only support a limited number of color spaces in their metadata. If the color space is unknown to the output form, then no metadata will be included.

#### Output Reference White `outputreferencewhite`

When converting the color values to the Working Color Space for output, this controls how they should be treated with respect to Reference White. If the Working Color Space is the same Reference White, then no adjustment is done. If they are different, then the Reference White level (brightness) of the colors will be adjusted to the range expected by the Output Color Space. For example if the project is set to have a SDR Reference White of 120 nits, and the HDR Reference White is 80 nits, and the project Working Color Space is HDR while the Output Color Space is SDR: then a color of (1, 1, 1), which is 80 nits in the HDR color space, will be converted to be (0.66, 0.66, 0.66), which is 80 nits still in the SDR Output Color Space.

- **Default For Color Space** `default` - Will use either the SDR or the HDR Reference White, based on the color space detected/selected.

#### Header Source DAT `headerdat`

The path to a Table DAT that stores header metadata that should be written to the output image or movie file. Header data is written as key-value pairs with the first column storing the keys and the second column storing the associated values. See File Metadata for more information on supported metadata. Note: Currently only supported for EXR files. Warning: Files may fail to save if the header data conflicts with system headers.

### EXR Page

#### Save as Point Cloud `pointcloud`

When enabled, an additional header will be added to the file that indicates the contents are point data rather than images. This header is used to automatically load the file into a Point File In TOP rather than a Movie File In TOP when dragging and dropping.

#### TOP `input0top`

### Settings Page

#### Stall for File Open `stallforopen`

When this is on playback will stall until the file is opened and ready to receive frames, to make sure the frame that was inputted when Record was turned on gets recorded. When this is off recording may start on a later frame, after the file has been opened. Turning this off can avoid a stall in playback, if missing recording some frames at the start is acceptable.

The number of slices each frame is split into.

#### Entropy Mode `entropymode`

Controls which entropy mode is used for H265 encoding.

- **Auto-Select** `autoselect`
- **CABAC** `cabac`
- **CAVLC** `cavlc`

#### Stereo Mode `stereomode`

Adds metadata to the file to denote that it contains a stereo pair of images in either Left-Right or Top-Bottom formatting. The TOP connected as the input needs to already be in this format, usually by using a Layout TOP.

- **Off** `off` - No metadata is included.
- **Left-Right** `leftright` - The metadata denotes that the content should be treated as the left half is the left eye, and the right half is the right eye.
- **Top-Bottom** `topbottom` - The metadata denotes that the content should be treated as the top half is the left eye, and the bottom half is the right eye.

#### Spherical Mode `sphericalmode`

- **Off** `off` - No metadata is included.
- **Equirectangular** `equirectangular` - The metadata denotes that the content is in Equirectuangular projection format.

#### Secondary Compression `secondarycompression`

Hap uses a secondary CPU compression stage usually. Encoding video without this compression will result in faster playback, but potentially larger file sizes (which would require faster drives to play back).

#### Encode Test Mode `encodetestmode`

This mode disables file writting, and only does the encoding. This is useful to test the GPU/CPU performance of encoding while taking the SSD speed out of the equation.

#### Include Mip Maps `mipmaps`

When saving out .dds file, mipmaps can be included if this is enabled. This is primarily used for the PreFilter Map TOP, which will encode special information into the mipmap levels of the texture which needs to be maintained.

### Common Page

#### Output Resolution `outputresolution`

quickly change the resolution of the TOP's data.

- **Use Input** `useinput` - Uses the input's resolution.
- **Eighth** `eighth` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
- **Quarter** `quarter` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
- **Half** `half` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
- **2X** `2x` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
- **4X** `4x` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
- **8X** `8x` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
- **Fit Resolution** `fit` - Fits the width and height to the resolution given below, while maintaining the aspect ratio.
- **Limit Resolution** `limit` - The width and height are limited to the resolution given below. If one of the dimensions exceeds the given resolution, the width and height will be reduced to fit inside the given limits while maintaining the aspect ratio.
- **Custom Resolution** `custom` - Enables the Resolution parameter below, giving direct control over width and height.

#### Resolution `resolution`

Enabled only when the Resolution parameter is set to Custom Resolution. Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions.

- **W** `resolutionw`
- **H** `resolutionh`

#### Resolution Menu `resmenu`

A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions.

#### Use Global Res Multiplier `resmult`

Uses the Global Resolution Multiplier found in Edit>Preferences>TOPs. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global Resolution Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this TOP is affected by the global multiplier.

#### Output Aspect `outputaspect`

Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)

- **Use Input** `useinput` - Uses the input's aspect ratio.
- **Resolution** `resolution` - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square.
- **Custom Aspect** `custom` - Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.

#### Aspect `aspect`

Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect.

- **Aspect1** `aspect1`
- **Aspect2** `aspect2`

#### Aspect Menu `armenu`

A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios.

#### Input Smoothness `inputfiltertype`

This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the TOP.

- **Nearest Pixel** `nearest` - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native Resolution.
- **Interpolate Pixels** `linear` - Uses linear filtering between pixels. This is how you get TOP images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native Resolution.
- **Mipmap Pixels** `mipmap` - Uses mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.

#### Fill Viewer `fillmode`

Determine how the TOP image is displayed in the viewer. NOTE:To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to Native Resolution as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.

- **Use Input** `useinput` - Uses the same Fill Viewer settings as it's input.
- **Fill** `fill` - Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer.

- **Fit Best** `best` - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped.
- **Fit Outside** `outside` - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer.
- **Native Resolution** `nativeres` - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.

#### Viewer Smoothness `filtertype`

This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.

- **Nearest Pixel** `nearest` - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native Resolution.
- **Interpolate Pixels** `linear` - Uses linear filtering between pixels. Use this to get TOP images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native Resolution.
- **Mipmap Pixels** `mipmap` - Uses mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.

#### Passes `npasses`

Duplicates the operation of the TOP the specified number of times. Making this larger than 1 is essentially the same as taking the output from each pass, and passing it into the first input of the node and repeating the process. Other inputs and parameters remain the same for each pass.

#### Channel Mask `chanmask`

Allows you to choose which channels (R, G, B, or A) the TOP will operate on. All channels are selected by default.

## Info CHOP Channels

Extra Information for the Movie File Out TOP can be accessed via an Info CHOP.

### Specific Movie File Out TOP Info Channels
- last_frames_written - The number of frames written to the file on the last cook. This many be multiple repeats of the same image if TouchDesigner dropped frames, to ensure time stays in sync.
- total_frames_written - The total number of frames written to the file so far.
- last_audio_samples_written - The number of audio samples written to the file on the last cook.
- total_audio_samples_written - The total number of audio samplers written to the file.
- last_audio_frames_written - The number of audio frames written to the file on the last cook. This is the samples value, converted to frame units.
- total_audio_frames_written - The total number of audio frames written to the file. This is the samples value, converted to frame units.
- total_frames_dropped - The number frames that TouchDesigner failed to provide unique images for in the output file. This occurs when TouchDesigner drops frames when the file needed new images.
- active_records - When recording sequences of images, they may be written using multiple CPUs at the same time. This tells how many images are currently being recorded.
- cur_seq_index - When recording sequences of images, this is the current sequence image index.

### Common TOP Info Channels
- resx - Horizontal resolution of the TOP in pixels.
- resy - Vertical resolution of the TOP in pixels.
- aspectx - Horizontal aspect of the TOP.
- aspecty - Vertical aspect of the TOP.
- depth - Depth of 2D or 3D array if this TOP contains a 2D or 3D texture array.
- gpu_memory_used - Total amount of texture memory used by this TOP.

### Common Operator Info Channels
- total_cooks - Number of times the operator has cooked since the process started.
- cook_time - Duration of the last cook in milliseconds.
- cook_frame - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the component timeline.
- cook_abs_frame - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the absolute time.
- cook_start_time - Time in milliseconds at which the operator started cooking in the frame it was cooked.
- cook_end_time - Time in milliseconds at which the operator finished cooking in the frame it was cooked.
- cooked_this_frame - 1 if operator was cooked this frame.
- warnings - Number of warnings in this operator if any.
- errors - Number of errors in this operator if any.
