# Ouster TOP

**Family:** TOP (Texture Operator)

## Summary

Ouster makes LIDAR devices for scanning 3D environments. The Ouster TOP sends and receives data with an Ouster Imaging Lidar, converting to point cloud data on the GPU. For more information see the user guides at Ouster.io

Requirements:

Features include:

Connection Instructions: To connect to the sensor, you will need either the IP addressed assigned by the local DHCP server or the name of the device. The name is based on the serial number that is usually printed on the top of the sensor in the format "os-############". This name can be entered directly into the Device Address parameter (see parameter help below). You can also connect to the device through a web browser using the IP or name in the format http://os-###########/. The web interface allows you to check the status of the device and gives additional error information.

Once the device is configured, it will continue to send output to the target IP address so it is not required to enter the device address again unless you need to change the configuration.

Range data collected from the device is presented as 32bit floating point values in the RGBA channels of the output image. The output is arranged as a panoramic image. IMU data from the device can be accessed by connecting an Info CHOP. If more than 4 output channels are needed, you can use a Ouster Select TOP to create additional output images.

Ouster Outputs: Range, Signal, Reflectivity, Near IR, and Flags are raw data channels coming from the sensor, while XYZ position values are calculated by using the range data and the look up table of beam azimuth and altitude angles. Range is measured in millimeters, while XYZ positions are in meters. If you need more than 4 channels of data, use a Ouster Select TOP to create a second output image from the same sensor data. In addition to the sensor data, you can also assign a constant value of one or zero to a channel by selecting the corresponding entry from the menu.

> **Note:** If the "os-############" syntax isn't able to connect, you can also try "os-############.local".

> **Note:** All 3D coordinates are transformed into TouchDesigner space where Y is up and X and Z represent the ground plane. This is different from the original coordinate space defined in the Ouster documentation.

## Parameters

### Connection Page

#### Active `active`

Enables connections with the device.

#### Re-Init `reinitialize`

Manually reinitialize the device.

#### Device Address `deviceaddress`

The IP address or the name of the Ouster device. The address is only required during configuration. The device will request an address from the local DHCP server when it is connected to the network. The name of the device is printed on the top of the sensor in the format "os-#####", where ##### is the serial number e.g. "os-991900123456". If you want to use the name of the device, you may have to input "os-#####.local" in this parameter to connect to your sensor. You can determine the IP address using the ping command and the device name e.g. ping -4 os-991900123456. For more information see the Ouster User Guide at Ouster.io.

#### Lidar Port `lidarport`

### Common Page

#### Output Resolution `outputresolution`

quickly change the resolution of the TOP's data.

- **Use Input** `useinput` - Uses the input's resolution
- **Eighth** `eighth` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
- **Quarter** `quarter` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
- **Half** `half` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.

- **Limit Resolution** `limit` - Limit the input resolution to be not larger than this resolution, while keeping the aspect ratio the same.
- **Custom Resolution** `custom` - Directly control the width and height.

#### Resolution `resolution`

Enabled only when the Resolution parameter is set to Custom Resolution. Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions.

- **W** `resolutionw`
- **H** `resolutionh`

#### Resolution Menu `resmenu`

A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions.

#### Use Global Res Multiplier `resmult`

Uses the Global Resolution Multiplier found in Edit>Preferences>TOPs. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global Resolution Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this TOP is affected by the global multiplier.

#### Output Aspect `outputaspect`

Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)

- **Use Input** `useinput` - Uses the input's aspect ratio.
- **Resolution** `resolution` - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square.
- **Custom Aspect** `custom` - Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.

#### Aspect `aspect`

Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect.

- **Aspect1** `aspect1`
- **Aspect2** `aspect2`

#### Aspect Menu `armenu`

A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios.

#### Input Smoothness `inputfiltertype`

This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the TOP.

- **Nearest Pixel** `nearest` - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native Resolution.
- **Interpolate Pixels** `linear` - Uses linear filtering between pixels. This is how you get TOP images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native Resolution.
- **Mipmap Pixels** `mipmap` - Uses mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.

#### Fill Viewer `fillmode`

Determine how the TOP image is displayed in the viewer. NOTE:To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to Native Resolution as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.

- **Use Input** `useinput` - Uses the same Fill Viewer settings as it's input.
- **Fill** `fill` - Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer.
- **Fit Horizontal** `width` - Stretches image to fit viewer horizontally.
- **Fit Vertical** `height` - Stretches image to fit viewer vertically.
- **Fit Best** `best` - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped.
- **Fit Outside** `outside` - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer.
- **Native Resolution** `nativeres` - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.

#### Viewer Smoothness `filtertype`

This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.

- **Nearest Pixel** `nearest` - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native Resolution.
- **Interpolate Pixels** `linear` - Uses linear filtering between pixels. Use this to get TOP images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native Resolution.
- **Mipmap Pixels** `mipmap` - Uses mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail. When the input is 32-bit float format, only nearest filtering will be used (regardless of what is selected).

#### Passes `npasses`

Duplicates the operation of the TOP the specified number of times. For every pass after the first it takes the result of the previous pass and replaces the node's first input with the result of the previous pass. One exception to this is the GLSL TOP when using compute shaders, where the input will continue to be the connected TOP's image.

#### Channel Mask `chanmask`

Allows you to choose which channels (R, G, B, or A) the TOP will operate on. All channels are selected by default.
