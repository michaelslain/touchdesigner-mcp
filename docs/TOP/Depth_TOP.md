# Depth TOP

**Family:** TOP (Texture Operator)

## Summary

The Depth TOP reads an image containing depth information from a scene described in a specified Render TOP. The resulting image is black (0) at pixels where the surface is at the near depth value (Camera's parameter "Near"). It is white (1) at pixels where the surface is at the far depth value (parameter "Far").

The Depth TOP is used to do shadow mapping. It can have many other uses also, such as edge detection based on depth.

The depth range is by definition the near plane -> far plane. Values in the Depth TOP will be 0 at the near plane, and 1 at the far plane. Generally the image in the Depth TOP will be white, unless you have your planes really tight around your object. But just because you can't visually see anything, it doesn't mean the information isn't there.

Another option is Linear Camera-Space Depth. If the Render TOP's Depth Buffer Format is set to 32-Bit Floating-Point and its Linear Camera-Space Depth parameter is on, then the Depth TOP will output linear camera space depth.

You can use the Level TOP to re-range the Depth TOP's values. However make sure you set the Pixel Format of the Level TOP to 16 or 32-bit, or you'll lose a lot of information from the Depth TOP's data (The Depth TOP has 24-bit data).

The Depth TOP creates a 24-bit fixed-point or 32-bit floating-point single channel image. When the Depth TOP is used as an input to another TOP, its data will be treated like an RGBA value of (D, D, D, 1). The same is true when sampling a depth texture in a GLSL shader.

## Parameters

#### Depth Space `depthspace`

The space the depth values should be output in.

- **Input** `input` - The unchanged values the shaders are writing for the depth values. Usually this is a logarithmic curve where 90% of the values are within the closest 10% of the distances to the near plane.
- **Camera Space** `cameraspace` - Convert the depth values to be in camera space, where 0 is at the camera and it is positive values moving away from the camera.
- **Reranged from Camera Space** `reranged` - First convert to camera space values just like the 'Camera Space' mode, but then apply a re-range operation to another custom range.

#### Range from `rangefrom`

The range to convert from when using 'Rerange from Camera Space'. This would often be your area of interest in the camera's depth.

- **rangefrom1** `rangefrom1` - The near range to re-range from.
- **rangefrom2** `rangefrom2` - The far range to re-range from.

#### Range to `rangeto`

The range of values you want to convert the depth values to. This is the range you would find the depth to more useful for processing, often 0-1.

- **rangeto1** `rangeto1` - The near range to re-range to.
- **rangeto2** `rangeto2` - The far range to re-range to.

#### Clamp to [0-1] `clamp`

Enable to clamp the depth values between 0 and 1.

#### Gamma `gamma`

### Common Page

#### Output Resolution `outputresolution`

quickly change the resolution of the TOP's data.

- **Use Input** `useinput` - Uses the input's resolution
- **Eighth** `eighth` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
- **Quarter** `quarter` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
- **Half** `half` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
- **2X** `2x` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
- **4X** `4x` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
- **8X** `8x` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
- **Fit Resolution** `fit` - Grow or shrink the input resolution to fit this resolution, while keeping the aspect ratio the same.
- **Limit Resolution** `limit` - Limit the input resolution to be not larger than this resolution, while keeping the aspect ratio the same.
- **Custom Resolution** `custom` - Directly control the width and height.

#### Resolution `resolution`

Enabled only when the Resolution parameter is set to Custom Resolution. Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions.

- **W** `resolutionw`
- **H** `resolutionh`

#### Resolution Menu `resmenu`

A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions.

#### Use Global Res Multiplier `resmult`

Uses the Global Resolution Multiplier found in Edit>Preferences>TOPs. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global Resolution Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this TOP is affected by the global multiplier.

#### Output Aspect `outputaspect`

Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)

- **Use Input** `useinput` - Uses the input's aspect ratio.
- **Resolution** `resolution` - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square.
- **Custom Aspect** `custom` - Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.

#### Aspect `aspect`

Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect.

- **Aspect1** `aspect1`
- **Aspect2** `aspect2`

#### Aspect Menu `armenu`

A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios.

#### Input Smoothness `inputfiltertype`

This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the TOP.

- **Nearest Pixel** `nearest` - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native Resolution.
- **Interpolate Pixels** `linear` - Uses linear filtering between pixels. This is how you get TOP images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native Resolution.
- **Mipmap Pixels** `mipmap` - Uses mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.

#### Fill Viewer `fillmode`

Determine how the TOP image is displayed in the viewer. NOTE:To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to Native Resolution as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.

- **Use Input** `useinput` - Uses the same Fill Viewer settings as it's input.
- **Fill** `fill` - Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer.
- **Fit Horizontal** `width` - Stretches image to fit viewer horizontally.
- **Fit Vertical** `height` - Stretches image to fit viewer vertically.
- **Fit Best** `best` - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped.
- **Fit Outside** `outside` - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer.
- **Native Resolution** `nativeres` - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.

#### Viewer Smoothness `filtertype`

This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.

- **Nearest Pixel** `nearest` - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native Resolution.
- **Interpolate Pixels** `linear` - Uses linear filtering between pixels. Use this to get TOP images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native Resolution.
- **Mipmap Pixels** `mipmap` - Uses mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail. When the input is 32-bit float format, only nearest filtering will be used (regardless of what is selected).

#### Passes `npasses`

Duplicates the operation of the TOP the specified number of times. For every pass after the first it takes the result of the previous pass and replaces the node's first input with the result of the previous pass. One exception to this is the GLSL TOP when using compute shaders, where the input will continue to be the connected TOP's image.

#### Channel Mask `chanmask`

Allows you to choose which channels (R, G, B, or A) the TOP will operate on. All channels are selected by default.

#### Pixel Format `format`

Format used to store data for each channel in the image (ie. R, G, B, and A). Refer to Pixel Formats for more information.

- **Use Input** `useinput` - Uses the input's pixel format.
- **8-bit fixed (RGBA)** `rgba8fixed` - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel.
- **sRGB 8-bit fixed (RGBA)** `srgba8fixed` - Uses 8-bit integer values for each channel and stores color in sRGB colorspace. Note that this does not apply an sRGB curve to the pixel values, it only stores them using an sRGB curve. This means more data is used for the darker values and less for the brighter values. When the values are read downstream they will be converted back to linear. For more information refer to sRGB.
- **16-bit float (RGBA)** `rgba16float` - Uses 16-bits per color channel, 64-bits per pixel.

- **11-bit float (RGB), Positive Values Only** `rgba11float` - A RGB floating point format that has 11 bits for the Red and Green channels, and 10-bits for the Blue Channel, 32-bits total per pixel (therefore the same memory usage as 8-bit RGBA). The Alpha channel in this format will always be 1. Values can go above one, but can't be negative. ie. the range is [0, infinite).
- **16-bit float (RGB)** `rgb16float`
