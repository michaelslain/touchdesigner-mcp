# Video Stream Out TOP

**Family:** TOP (Texture Operator)

## Summary

The Video Stream Out TOP acts as an RTMP or SRT sender, can create an RTSP server, to send compressed video and audio across the network. It uses Nvidia's hardware encoder. For RTSP, it can handle multiple clients connecting to it at the same time. Multiple Video Stream Out TOPs using the same port will be handled using the same underlying RTSP server. The Video Stream Out TOP can also be used to send a video stream through WebRTC video/audio tracks.

The video codecs that can be streamed out are H.264, H.265 (HEVC) and AV1. (AV1 is supported by recent NVIDIA GPUs only.). Not every streaming protocol and/or service supports every codec option.

The audio codecs that can be streamed out are MP3, AAC and Opus.

Enhanced RTMP is also supported.

To obtain the RTMP URL stream to, you may need to search to find the correct URL depending on your location and the service you are using. This should be in the format:

{service url}/{stream key}.

For example for Twitch the URL would be something like

rtmp://live-yto.twitch.tv/app/live_1234567_sduhy3xJ1KJ34Eg6CjksdJLubFS7gtUY

For more information on different services see RTMP.

SRT can use either H.264 or H.265 video codec. It can also send per-frame metadata when a CHOP or DAT is specified in the Per-Frame Metadata parameter.

The SRT server is settings are controlled by URL options. E.g to create a Video Stream Out, in listener-mode you'd specify the URL:

srt://0.0.0.0:9494?mode=listener

To connect to listener in a Video Stream In TOP, you'd do:

srt://127.0.0.1:9494?mode=caller

Either side of the connection can be the listener or the caller, it doesn't matter which is sending the video and which is receiving the video. The receiver would set their mode to be the opposite of whatever the sender is setting their mode to be.

All the options that are available are listed here. Multiple options can be set using a & as separator. E.g

srt://127.0.0.1:9494?mode=caller&send_buffer_size=100000

SRT sent from the Video Stream Out TOP can include per-frame metadata making it easy to send and receive CHOP/DAT data in sync with video. It can be read with the Video Stream In TOP.

Obtain the URL to connect to the Video Steam Out TOP's RTSP server by using an Info DAT or by middle clicking on the node. It will be in the form:

rtsp://<ipaddress>:<port>/<streamName>

e.g.

rtsp://192.168.0.1:554/tdvidstream

RTSP streaming does not support sending directly to another RTSP server via RTP.

NVIDIA Geforce level cards have a limit of 8 encoders sessions available per-system. Using a lower resolution does not avoid the encoder session limit. Quadros/RTX Pro cards have no session limit. In either case, the total amount of pixels that can be encoded will depend on the underlaying hardware, with newer/more powerful cards being able to encode more pixels. Refer to Nvidia Video GPU Support Matrix for more information.

One test using the default TouchDesigner startup file on a M6000 was able to do 13 1080p@30hz Video Stream Out TOPs.

See also the Video Stream In TOP, RTMP, RTSP and Video Streaming User Guide, Movie File Out TOP.

For other protocols over IP see NDI (Network Data Interface), and Touch Out TOP / Touch In TOP.

NOTE for Windows OS - If experiencing connection issues make sure Windows Firewall is disabled.

## Parameters

Selects if the mode works as an RTSP server, sends RTMP to a receiever such as a distribution service like YouTube or Twitch, or sends to an SRT destination.

- **RTSP Server** `rtspserver` - Use the RTSP and RTP protocol. More information here.
- **RTMP Sender** `rtmpsender` - Use the RTMP protocol. More information here.
- **SRT** `srt` - Use the SRT protocol. More information here.
- **WebRTC** `webrtc` - Use a WebRTC peer. More info: WebRTC, WebRTC DAT.

#### Network Port `port`

The port the server should listen on. Multiple Video Stream Out TOPs can use the same port as long as each has a unique Stream Name.

#### Stream Name `streamname`

The name of the stream for this node. This name is what comes after the / in the URL after the ipaddress:port combination.

#### Multi-Cast `multicast`

Controls if RTSP server sends its video out using unicast or multicast UDP packets.

#### Destination URL `url`

The URL to send the SRT/RTMP stream to. For RTMP, this should be in the format of {service url}/{stream key}. For example for twitch the URL would be something like rtmp://live-yto.twitch.tv/app/live_1234567_sduhy3xJ1KJ34Eg6CjksdJLubFS7gtUY. You may need to search to find the correct URL depending on your location and the service you are using. For SRT refer to the SRT documentation or the note at the start of this page.

#### Force IDR `forceidr`

For debugging, this will force the server to create a new video keyframe to send to all the clients. If clients aren't getting proper image this can be used to attempt to fix it. If you need to use this parameter please report the case to support@derivative.ca.

#### FPS `fps`

The FPS to send video at.

#### Video Codec `videocodec`

Select which codec to use for encoding the stream, not every codec is compatible with every streaming protocol

#### Max B-Frames `maxbframes`

The maximum number of bi-directional frames that can occur between keyframes. More will increase latency but reduce bandwidth.

#### Intra-Refresh Period `intrarefreshperiod`

Intra-refresh is a gradual keyframe that is applied across the image to clean up streaming artifacts over multiple frames, instead of one large keyframe. This controls the number of frames that elapse between each intra-refresh occuring.

#### Intra-Refresh Length `intrarefreshlength`

### Common Page

#### Output Resolution `outputresolution`

quickly change the resolution of the TOP's data.

- **Use Input** `useinput` - Uses the input's resolution.
- **Eighth** `eighth` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
- **Quarter** `quarter` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
- **Half** `half` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
- **2X** `2x` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
- **4X** `4x` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
- **8X** `8x` - Multiply the input's resolution by that amount.
- **Fit Resolution** `fit` - Fits the width and height to the resolution given below, while maintaining the aspect ratio.
- **Limit Resolution** `limit` - The width and height are limited to the resolution given below. If one of the dimensions exceeds the given resolution, the width and height will be reduced to fit inside the given limits while maintaining the aspect ratio.
- **Custom Resolution** `custom` - Enables the Resolution parameter below, giving direct control over width and height.

#### Resolution `resolution`

Enabled only when the Resolution parameter is set to Custom Resolution. Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions.

- **W** `resolutionw`
- **H** `resolutionh`

#### Resolution Menu `resmenu`

A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions.

#### Use Global Res Multiplier `resmult`

Uses the Global Resolution Multiplier found in Edit>Preferences>TOPs. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global Resolution Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this TOP is affected by the global multiplier.

#### Output Aspect `outputaspect`

Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)

- **Use Input** `useinput` - Uses the input's aspect ratio.
- **Resolution** `resolution` - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square.
- **Custom Aspect** `custom` - Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.

#### Aspect `aspect`

Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect.

- **Aspect1** `aspect1`
- **Aspect2** `aspect2`

#### Aspect Menu `armenu`

A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios.

#### Input Smoothness `inputfiltertype`

This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the TOP.

- **Nearest Pixel** `nearest` - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native Resolution.
- **Interpolate Pixels** `linear` - Uses linear filtering between pixels. This is how you get TOP images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native Resolution.
- **Mipmap Pixels** `mipmap` - Uses mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.

#### Fill Viewer `fillmode`

Determine how the TOP image is displayed in the viewer. NOTE:To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to Native Resolution as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.

- **Use Input** `useinput` - Uses the same Fill Viewer settings as it's input.
- **Fill** `fill` - Stretches the image to fit the edges of the viewer.
- **Fit Horizontal** `width` - Stretches image to fit viewer horizontally.
- **Fit Vertical** `height` - Stretches image to fit viewer vertically.
- **Fit Best** `best` - Stretches or squashes image so no part of image is cropped.
- **Fit Outside** `outside` - Stretches or squashes image so image fills viewer while constraining it's proportions. This often leads to part of image getting cropped by viewer.
- **Native Resolution** `nativeres` - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.

#### Viewer Smoothness `filtertype`

This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.

- **Nearest Pixel** `nearest` - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native Resolution.
- **Interpolate Pixels** `linear` - Uses linear filtering between pixels. Use this to get TOP images in viewers to look good at various zoom levels, especially useful when using any Fill Viewer setting other than Native Resolution.
- **Mipmap Pixels** `mipmap` - Uses mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.

#### Passes `npasses`

Duplicates the operation of the TOP the specified number of times. Making this larger than 1 is essentially the same as taking the output from each pass, and passing it into the first input of the node and repeating the process. Other inputs and parameters remain the same for each pass.

#### Channel Mask `chanmask`

Allows you to choose which channels (R, G, B, or A) the TOP will operate on. All channels are selected by default.
