# Point Transform TOP

**Family:** TOP (Texture Operator)

## Summary

The Point Transform TOP treats the RGB values of the input image as a point cloud of XYZ positions or vectors and performs 3D transformations and alignments. When the input type is set to 'Vector', translations are ignored and only rotation and scaling operations are performed. The alpha channel, if present, is passed along to the output image unchanged.

Transformations can be defined directly on the Transform page, taken from an input CHOP (see Transform CHOP), using the Look At parameter, or as a combination of any of those methods.

The Align page allows you to move or scale the point cloud relative to the origin, a 1x1x1 cube, or to a reference object. For example, you can scale the cloud to fit inside another point cloud or piece of geometry, or you can align the point cloud to sit on the XZ plane, or directly beside another cloud.

The second input can optionally be used as a weight map to control how much of the transformation is applied to each individual point.

## Parameters

### Transform Page

#### Input Type `inputtype`

Choose if the RGB channels of the input texture should be treated as positions or vectors. Vectors will not have the translation portion of the transform applied to them, and can be normalized before and/or after the transformation is applied.

- **Position** `position` - The RGB values represent XYZ positions.
- **Vector** `vector` - The RGB values represent XYZ directions.

#### Normalize Input `innormalize`

RGB input vectors are rescaled to a length of one before they are transformed.

#### Normalize Output `outnormalize`

RGB vectors are rescaled to a length of one after they are transformed.

#### Transform Order `xord`

Changes the order that the translate, rotate and scale operations are performed on the input. Analogous to how you would end up in different locations if you were to move a block and turn east, versus turning east and then moving a block. In matrix math terms, if we use the 'multiply vector on the right' (column vector) convention, a transform order of Scale, Rotate, Translate would be written as T * R * S * Position

- **Scale Rotate Translate** `srt`
- **Scale Translate Rotate** `str`
- **Rotate Scale Translate** `rst`
- **Rotate Translate Scale** `rts`
- **Translate Scale Rotate** `tsr`
- **Translate Rotate Scale** `trs`

#### Rotate Order `rord`

As with transform order (above), changing the order in which the rotations take place will alter the final position and orientation. A Rotation order of Rx Ry Rz would create the final rotation matrix as follows R = Rz * Ry * Rx

- **Rx Ry Rz** `xyz`
- **Rx Rz Ry** `xzy`
- **Ry Rx Rz** `yxz`
- **Ry Rz Rx** `yzx`
- **Rz Rx Ry** `zxy`
- **Rz Ry Rx** `zyx`

#### Translate `t`

Move the input positions in the X, Y and Z axes. If the input is set to 'Vector', the translate values will have no effect.

- **Translate** `tx`
- **Translate** `ty`
- **Translate** `tz`

#### Rotate `r`

Rotate the input RGB values around the corresponding X, Y and Z axes. Angles are given in degrees.

- **Rotate** `rx`
- **Rotate** `ry`
- **Rotate** `rz`

#### Scale `s`

Scale the input RGB values in the corresponding X, Y and Z axes. If 'Normalize Output' is on, then all output values will be rescaled to a length of one regardless of the scale values.

- **Scale** `sx`
- **Scale** `sy`
- **Scale** `sz`

#### Pivot `p`

The pivot is the point about which the input points or vectors are scaled and rotated. Altering the pivot point produces different results depending on the transformation performed on the object.

- **Pivot** `px`
- **Pivot** `py`
- **Pivot** `pz`

#### Uniform Scale `scale`

Scale the input values along all axes simultaneously.

#### Invert `invert`

Invert the transformation i.e. preform the reverse movements.

#### Look At `lookat`

Allows you to orient your input points by naming the object you would like them to Look At, or point to. Once you have designated this object to look at, it will continue to face that object, even if you move it.

#### Up Vector `upvector`

When orienting an object towards the 'Look At' target, the Up Vector is used to determine where the positive Y axis points.

- **Up Vector** `upvectorx`
- **Up Vector** `upvectory`
- **Up Vector** `upvectorz`

#### Forward Direction `forwarddir`

Sets which axis and direction is considered the forward direction.

- **Custom Resolution** `custom` - Enables the Resolution parameter below, giving direct control over width and height.

#### Resolution `resolution`

Enabled only when the Resolution parameter is set to Custom Resolution. Some Generators like Constant and Ramp do not use inputs and only use this field to determine their size. The drop down menu on the right provides some commonly used resolutions.

- **W** `resolutionw`
- **H** `resolutionh`

#### Resolution Menu `resmenu`

A drop-down menu with some commonly used resolutions.

#### Use Global Res Multiplier `resmult`

Uses the Global Resolution Multiplier found in Edit>Preferences>TOPs. This multiplies all the TOPs resolutions by the set amount. This is handy when working on computers with different hardware specifications. If a project is designed on a desktop workstation with lots of graphics memory, a user on a laptop with only 64MB VRAM can set the Global Resolution Multiplier to a value of half or quarter so it runs at an acceptable speed. By checking this checkbox on, this TOP is affected by the global multiplier.

#### Output Aspect `outputaspect`

Sets the image aspect ratio allowing any textures to be viewed in any size. Watch for unexpected results when compositing TOPs with different aspect ratios. (You can define images with non-square pixels using xres, yres, aspectx, aspecty where xres/yres != aspectx/aspecty.)

- **Use Input** `useinput` - Uses the input's aspect ratio.
- **Resolution** `resolution` - Uses the aspect of the image's defined resolution (ie 512x256 would be 2:1), whereby each pixel is square.
- **Custom Aspect** `custom` - Lets you explicitly define a custom aspect ratio in the Aspect parameter below.

#### Aspect `aspect`

Use when Output Aspect parameter is set to Custom Aspect.

- **Aspect1** `aspect1`
- **Aspect2** `aspect2`

#### Aspect Menu `armenu`

A drop-down menu with some commonly used aspect ratios.

#### Input Smoothness `inputfiltertype`

This controls pixel filtering on the input image of the TOP.

- **Nearest Pixel** `nearest` - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native Resolution.

- **Mipmap Pixels** `mipmap` - Uses mipmap filtering when scaling images. This can be used to reduce artifacts and sparkling in moving/scaling images that have lots of detail.

#### Fill Viewer `fillmode`

Determine how the TOP image is displayed in the viewer. NOTE:To get an understanding of how TOPs work with images, you will want to set this to Native Resolution as you lay down TOPs when starting out. This will let you see what is actually happening without any automatic viewer resizing.

- **Native Resolution** `nativeres` - Displays the native resolution of the image in the viewer.

#### Viewer Smoothness `filtertype`

This controls pixel filtering in the viewers.

- **Nearest Pixel** `nearest` - Uses nearest pixel or accurate image representation. Images will look jaggy when viewing at any zoom level other than Native Resolution.
