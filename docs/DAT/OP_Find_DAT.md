# OP Find DAT

**Family:** DAT (Data Operator)

## Summary

The OP Find DAT traverses the component hierarchy starting at one component and looking at all nodes within that component, and outputs a table with one row per node that matches criteria the user chooses. For example, the criteria could be all Ramp TOPs, or all nodes whose name starts with “wave”, or all nodes with the Clone parameter set to “master1”, or all Geometry components with a tag called “emitter”.

The criteria can limited to include only nodes of certain families, or certain operator types. It can filter on matching its path, certain parameters containing certain values (both constant and expressions), comments, tags, or the content of a DAT containing certain strings.

You can also cause the DAT to only look to some depth of the hierarchy from the specified component, such as 2 levels down, or limitless.

Criteria can be case-sensitive or not, but case-sensitive On or Off applies to all criteria in the OP Find DAT.

Furthermore you can exclude some nodes using more specialized criteria by returning a True of False in a callback contained in the attached callback DAT.

With the Combine Filters Menu (Any or All, Default is All), you can do an "or" or "and" on the pattern matching criterea.

It also takes an optional DAT containing a list of operators (eg, another OP Find DAT) which can be used to chain filters.

There is a variety of columns that you can select from including name, id, paths, type and tags. (id is a member of the operator, which is an integer unique to the node, and doesn't change during the running of the TouchDesigner process.)

You can also output custom columns by defining the column names in the callback DAT, and filling in the column cells via another function in the callback DAT. For example, you can output a custom column which is the tx parameter value of the node.

You can control when the OP Find DAT cooks. Normally it cooks whenever any of the nodes in the specified hierarchy changes. Using the Active Cook menu parameter, you can also force-cook it every frame, or turn off cooking entirely. You can also click the Pulse parameter on Active Cook in order to force-cook it once, or do the equivalent using the node.cookpulse.pulse() python call.

Instead of being give the path to a component to start at, the OP Find DAT can take an input DAT containing a pre-generated list of paths to nodes to start from, and merge the results of each input line together in the output. To use this, the input DAT should contain the node “id” as the first column, which can be generated with another OP Find DAT with the Column called “ID” turned on.

For example, say you first list all components that are panels, then you separate into groups based on type or Clone parameter. The first OP Find DAT pre-filters a huge hierarchy to a small fraction of the nodes, the subsequent OP Find DATs are operating on simpler sets to eliminate a lot of checking and cooking.

## Parameters

### Component Page

#### Active Cook `activecook`

Determines when to cook the DAT.

- **Off** `off` - This stops the operator from cooking altogether.
- **Automatic** `auto` - Only cook / update the contents when the results would change.
- **Always** `always` - Continually cook this operator repeatedly for update cases that might be missed.
- **Incremental** `incremental` - This will cook each frame, but only add one result per cook, until all results are added. At that point cooking stops.

#### Cook Pulse `cookpulse`

Manually force the OP Find DAT to update.

#### Component `component`

The path to the component where the search starts from.

#### Include Component `includecomponent`

Include the component the search starts from in the search itself.

#### Include Wire Hierarchy `includewired`

Any components wired to the starting component are included in the search.

#### Minimum Depth `mindepth`

Set a minmum depth for the sub-components the OP Find DAT should recursively search through.

#### Limit Max Depth `limitmaxdepth`

Turns on the Maximum Depth parameter to limit searching through sub-components. Turning this toggle off will search through all sub-networks.

#### Maximum Depth `maxdepth`

Set the maximum depth for the sub-components the OP Find DAT should recursively search through.

#### Limit Max Operators `limitmaxops`

Limit the total number of operators iterated in the search.

#### Maximum Operators `maxops`

Number of operators the search is limited to.

### Families Page

#### Object COMPs `objects`

Include Object COMPs, like Geo COMP, in the search.

#### Panel COMPs `panels`

Include Panel COMPs, like Container COMP, in the search.

#### Other COMPs `other`

#### MATs `mats`

Include MAT family operators in the search.

#### DATs `dats`

Include DAT family operators in the search.

### Filters Page

#### Case Sensitive `casesensitive`

Use case sensitivity in all pattern matching below.

#### Combine Filters `combinefilters`

Combine 'All', 'Any' or 'Custom' of the filters below to get a match. 'Custom' allows for specifying a subselection of filters with 'or' and 'and' keywords.

- **All** `all` - All filters must match for an operator to be included in the search result. (AND)
- **Any** `any` - Any of the filter conditions must be met for an operator to be included in the search result. (OR)
- **Custom** `custom`

#### Custom Combine `customcombine`

Specify which filters to combine in the search.

#### Name `namefilter`

Use the operator's names like 'wave1', 'wave2', etc.

#### Type `typefilter`

Use names like waveCHOP and panelexecuteDAT. Look at the column Type to see the syntax.

#### Parent Shortcut `parentshortcutfilter`

Only match operators that include the here specified Parent Shortcut.

#### OP Shortcut `opshortcutfilter`

Only match operators that include the here specified OP Shortcut.

#### Path `pathfilter`

Specify a path that the operator should be located in.

#### Parent Path (relative) `parentfilter`

Specify a relative parent path that operators should be located in. This is a filter option on the parentPath column of this DAT that can be enabled by toggling the Parent Path parameter on this DAT's Columns page.

Specify a relative path that should be excluded from the search.
