# OP Execute DAT

**Family:** DAT (Data Operator)

## Summary

The OP Execute DAT runs a script when the state of an operator changes.

OP Execute DATs are created with default python method placeholders. For each monitored condition in the parameters, there is a matching python method in the DAT. When a condition is turned on in the parameters, each time that condition is satisfied the corresponding python method will be executed.

## Parameters

### OP Execute Page

#### Active `active`

While on, the DAT will respond to the OP that is referenced.

#### Execute from `executeloc`

(Tscript only) Determines the location the script is run from.

- **Current Node** `current` - (Tscript only) The script is executed from the current node location.
- **This Node** `here` - The script is executed from the parent of the DAT. The DAT executes from the parent to make siblings of the DAT easy to access: DAT scripts used to execute from inside the DAT.
- **Specified Operator** `op` - The script is executed from the operator specified in the From Operator parameter below.

#### From Operator `fromop`

The path that the script will be executed from if the Execute From parameter is set to Specified Operator.

#### Monitor OPs `op`

Specify which operators to monitor to trigger the scripts.

#### Pre Cook `precook`

The onPreCook() method is triggered before the operator is cooked.

#### Post Cook `postcook`

The onPostCook() method is triggered after the operator is cooked.

#### Destroy `opdelete`

The onDestroy() method is triggered when the operator is deleted.

#### Flag Change `flagchange`

The onFlagChange() method is triggered when one of the operator's Flags changes state. This includes all the flags in the Common Flags list of an OP_Class, plus all the python accessible flags listed in COMP_Class, SOP_Class, CHOP_Class.

#### Wire Change `wirechange`

The onWireChange() method is triggered when the operator's inputs are rewired (connected, disconnected, swapped).

#### Name Change `namechange`

The onNameChange() method is triggered when the name of the operator is changed.

#### Path Change `pathchange`

The onPathChange() method is triggered when the path of the operator is changed.

#### UI Change `uichange`

The onUIChange() method is triggered when operator is resized or moved in the network editor.

#### Number Children Change `numchildrenchange`

The onNumChildrenChange() method is triggered if the number of children an operator has changes. Only works with Component type operators.

#### Child Rename `childrename`

The onChildRename() method is triggered if a child of the operator is renamed.

#### Current Child Change `currentchildchange`

The onCurrentChildChange() method is triggered if a child of the operator is made current in a network. Only works with Component type operators.

#### Extension Change `extensionchange`

The onExtensionChange() method is triggered when an extension of the operator is changed.

#### Edit.. `edit`

Clicking this opens a text editor to edit text in the DAT.

### File Page

#### File `file`

The filesystem path and name of the file to load. Accepts .txt and .dat files.

#### Sync to File `syncfile`

When On, loads the file from disk into the DAT when the projects starts. A filename must be specified. Turning on the option will load the file from disk immediately. If the file does not exist, it will be created the first time the DAT is updated. The file is monitored so that any changes made to the file will update the DAT, and any changes made to the DAT will be written to the file right away. If the file is removed, the DAT will retain its current contents.

#### Load on Start `loadonstart`

When On, reloads the file from disk into the DAT when the projects starts.

#### Load File `loadonstartpulse`

Instantly reloads the file.

#### Write on Toe Save `write`

When On, writes the contents of the DAT out to the file on disk when the project is saved.

#### Write File `writepulse`

Instantly write the file to disk.

### Common Page

#### Language `language`

Select how the DAT decides which script language to operate on.

- **Input** `input` - The DAT uses the inputs script language.
- **Node** `node` - The DAT uses it's own script language.

#### Edit/View Extension `extension`

Select the file extension this DAT should expose to external editors.

- **dat** `dat` - various common file extensions.
- **From Language** `language` - pick extension from DATs script language.
- **Custom Extension** `custom` - Specify a custom extension.

#### Custom Extension `customext`

Specifiy the custom extension.

#### Word Wrap `wordwrap`

- **Input** `input` - The DAT uses the inputs setting.
- **On** `on` - Turn on Word Wrap.
- **Off** `off` - Turn off Word Wrap.
