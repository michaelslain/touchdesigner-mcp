# Text DAT

**Family:** DAT (Data Operator)

## Summary

The Text DAT lets you edit free-form, multi-line ASCII text. It is used for scripts, GLSL shaders, notes, XML and other purposes. "Free-form text" is one of the two forms of DATs (the other being tables of rows and columns of cells, each cell containing a text string as in a Table DAT).

Text can be typed into the DAT when its Viewer Active is on, or in an external text editor. The Text DAT can get its data from a file on disk or from a file on the web. Use http:// when specifying a remote text file.

See also the Execute DATs which are specialized to run their text as a script: CHOP Execute DAT runs its script when a CHOP channel changes, DAT Execute DAT when a DAT changes, Execute DAT when you start or end your TouchDesigner process or want to run a script every frame, Panel Execute DAT when a control panel changes, Parameter Execute DAT when a parameter of a node changes, and OP Execute DAT when anything else about an operator changes, including creation and deletion of nodes in a component's network.

Use the Web DAT to fetch via a URL query.

If the file is removed, the DAT will retain its current contents.

#### Load on Start `loadonstart`

When On, reloads the file from disk into the DAT when the projects starts.

#### Load File `loadonstartpulse`

Instantly reloads the file.
