# Perform DAT

**Family:** DAT (Data Operator)

## Summary

The Perform DAT logs various performance times in a Table DAT format. These benchmarks are similar to those reported by the Performance Monitor.

## Parameters

### Perform Page

#### Active `active`

Turns logging on/off. The DAT will continuously log while Active is On.

- **Active** `active`
- **Active Pulse** `activepulse`

#### Trigger Mode `triggermode`

Offers two options for when to trigger a refresh of the logs.

- **When Frame Length Exceeds Threshold** `threshold` - Use the Trigger Threshold parameter below to set a maximum frame time to wait before refreshing the log.
- **When a Frame is Dropped** `droppedframe` - Refresh the log as soon as a frame is dropped.

#### Trigger Threshold `triggerthreshold`

This is the amount of time, in milliseconds, that a frame must exceed to cause the DAT to log and output the frame's timing. For example to see what happens when a frame takes more that 33 ms to cook, put this parameter to 33.

#### Cook Time `logcook`

Logs the cook time of operators.

#### Export Time `logexport`

Logs time spent exporting CHOP channels.

#### Viewport Draw Time `logviewport`

Logs time to draw 3D geometry and SOP viewers.

#### Movie Time `logmovie`

Logs time taken to read video and audio from movie files.

#### Draw Channels Time `logdrawchannels`

Logs time to draw channels in CHOP viewers.

#### Object View Time `logobjectview`

Logs time to draw objects in 3D viewers.

#### Custom Panel Time `logcustompanel`

Logs time taken by custom panels build with Panel Components.

#### MIDI Time `logmidi`

Logs time spent on MIDI.

#### Graphics Time `loggraphics`

Logs various graphics system calls, such as time spent waiting for the graphics card, calls to the graphic driver, converting TOP data to CHOPs, etc.

#### Frame Length `logframelength`

Logs total frame time in milliseconds (ms).

#### Misc `logmisc`

Logs miscellaneous times that do not fit into other categories.

#### Script `logscript`

Logs time spent running scripts.

#### Render `logrender`

Logs time spend by Render or Renderpass TOPs.

#### Callbacks DAT `callbacks`

A path to the Callbacks DAT. Newly created Perform DATs include a docked Callbacks DAT.

#### Clear `clear`

Clears the contents of the DAT.

#### Active Pulse `activepulse`

Use resetpulse button to grab a single frame snapshot.

### Common Page

#### Language `language`

Select how the DAT decides which script language to operate on.

- **Input** `input` - The DAT uses the inputs script language.
- **Node** `node` - The DAT uses it's own script language.

#### Edit/View Extension `extension`

Select the file extension this DAT should expose to external editors.

- **dat** `dat` - various common file extensions.
- **From Language** `language` - pick extension from DATs script language.
- **Custom Extension** `custom` - Specify a custom extension.

#### Custom Extension `customext`

Specifiy the custom extension.

#### Word Wrap `wordwrap`

Enable Word Wrap for Node Display.

- **Input** `input` - The DAT uses the inputs setting.
- **On** `on` - Turn on Word Wrap.
- **Off** `off` - Turn off Word Wrap.

## Info CHOP Channels

Extra Information for the Perform DAT can be accessed via an Info CHOP.
