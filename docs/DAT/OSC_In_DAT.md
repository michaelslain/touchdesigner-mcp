# OSC In DAT

**Family:** DAT (Data Operator)

## Summary

The OSC In DAT receives and parses full Open Sound Control packets using UDP by default. Each packet is parsed and appended as a row in the DAT's table. The table is FIFO "fisrt-in first-out" and limited to parameter-set number of lines. An optional script may be run for each packet received. Each packet/row represents either one OSC message, or an entire OSC bundle. Each argument is translated into readable ASCII text.

The supported argument tag types are:

In the case of multi-vectored arguments (example "blob", "midi", "rgb", etc), the list of values is enclosed in double quotes. In the case of unknown argument types, a quoted list of decimal values representing the bytes of that argument are included instead.

NOTE for Windows OS - If experiencing connection issues make sure Windows Firewall is disabled.

## Parameters

### Connect Page

#### Active `active`

While on, the DAT receives information sent to the network port. While Off, no updating occurs. Data sent to the port is lost.

#### Protocol `protocol`

Select which protocol to use, refer to the Network Protocols article for more information.

- **Messaging (UDP)** `msging`
- **Multi-Cast Messaging (UDP)** `multicastmsging`
- **Reliable Messaging (UDT Library)** `reliablemsging`

#### Network Address `address`

For multi-cast protocol, this is the multi-cast address to listen for. For UDT protocol this is the IP address of the server.

#### Port `port`

The port which OSC-In will accept packets on.

#### Local Address `localaddress`

Specify an IP address to receive on, useful when the system has mulitple NICs (Network Interface Card) and you want to select which one to use.

#### Shared Connection `shared`

Use the same connection as other networking DATs using the same network protocol.

#### OSC Address Scope `addscope`

To reduce which message are generated, you can use message address name patterns to include or exclude messages. For example, ^*accel* will exclude accelerometer messages coming in from an iOS or iPhone app like mrmr. See Pattern Matching for the syntax of the possible address name patterns.

#### Include Type Tag `typetag`

Includes the argument list type tag in each message. It includes the parameter type keywords (in case the parsing application needs to identify parameter types).

#### Split Bundle into Messages `splitbundle`

When On, each message contained within a bundle is given its own row.

#### Split Message into Columns `splitmessage`

When On, OSC address and arguments are given individual columns, otherwise they are included in the message column.

#### Bundle Timestamp Column `bundletimestamp`

When On, each bundle timestamp value is included in a column.

### Received Messages Page

#### Callbacks DAT `callbacks`

The Callbacks DAT will execute once for each message received. See oscinDAT_Class for usage.

#### Execute from `executeloc`

Determines the location the script is run from.

- **Current Node** `current` - The script is executed from the current node location.
- **Callbacks DAT** `callbacks` - The script is executed from the location of the DAT specified in the Callbacks DAT parameter.
- **Specified Operator** `op` - The script is executed from the operator specified in the From Operator parameter below.

#### From Operator `fromop`

The operator whose state change will trigger the DAT to execute its script when Execute from is set to Specified Operator. This operator is also the path that the script will be executed from if the Execute From parameter is set to Specified Operator.

#### Clamp Output `clamp`

The DAT is limited to 100 messages by default but with Clamp Output, this can be set to anything including unlimited.

#### Maximum Lines `maxlines`

Limits the number of messages, older messages are removed from the list first.

#### Clear Output `clear`

Deletes all lines except the heading. To clear with a python script op("opname").par.clear.pulse()

#### Bytes Column `bytes`

Outputs the raw bytes of the message in a separate column.

### Common Page

#### Language `language`

Select how the DAT decides which script language to operate on.

- **Input** `input` - The DAT uses the inputs script language.
- **Node** `node` - The DAT uses it's own script language.

#### Edit/View Extension `extension`

Select the file extension this DAT should expose to external editors.

- **dat** `dat` - various common file extensions.
- **From Language** `language` - pick extension from DATs script language.
- **Custom Extension** `custom` - Specify a custom extension.

#### Custom Extension `customext`

Specifiy the custom extension.

#### Word Wrap `wordwrap`

Enable Word Wrap for Node Display.

- **Input** `input` - The DAT uses the inputs setting.
- **On** `on` - Turn on Word Wrap.
- **Off** `off` - Turn off Word Wrap.

## Operator Inputs
