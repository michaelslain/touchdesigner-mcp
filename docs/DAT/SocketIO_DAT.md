# SocketIO DAT

**Family:** DAT (Data Operator)

## Summary

The SocketIO DAT connects to a Socket.IO server at the specified URL.

The SocketIO DAT has 4 inputs in the following order (example):

The SocketIO DAT can also emit events to the server. This is done using the python emit method. Acknowledgement callbacks are not supported.

The SocketIO DAT is built with socket.io's C++ Client API v3.1.0 and works with socket.io v3 or v4 servers.

The SocketIO DAT prints socket.io status messages to the TouchDesigner text console. The text console can be enabled by setting the environment variable TOUCH_TEXT_CONSOLE=1 (see: https://docs.derivative.ca/Variables#System_Environment_Variables). The text console will open the next time TouchDesigner is launched.

## Parameters

### Connect Page

#### Active `active`

When enabled, the SocketIO DAT is actively listening for events from the server, and can also emit events.

#### Reset `reset`

Disconnects the connection and then reconnects.

#### URL `url`

The URL of the socket.io server.

#### Verify Certificate (TLS) `verifycert`

Enables TLS (transport layer security) certificate verification.

#### Reconnect Delay `delay`

The delay in milliseconds between reconnection attempts.

### Received Messages Page

#### Callbacks DAT `callbacks`

The Callbacks DAT will execute once for each message coming in.

#### Execute from `executeloc`

Determines the location the script is run from.

- **Current Node** `current` - The script is executed from the current node location.
- **Callbacks DAT** `callbacks` - The script is executed from the location of the DAT specified in the Callbacks DAT parameter.
- **Specified Operator** `op` - The script is executed from the operator specified in the From Operator parameter below.

#### From Operator `fromop`

The operator whose state change will trigger the DAT to execute its script when Execute from is set to Specified Operator. This operator is also the path that the script will be executed from if the Execute from parameter is set to Specified Operator.

#### Clamp Output `clamp`

The DAT is limited to 100 messages by default but with Clamp Output, this can be set to anything including unlimited.

#### Maximum Lines `maxlines`

Limits the number of messages, older messages are removed from the list first.

#### Clear Output `clear`

Deletes all lines except the heading. To clear with a python script op("opname").par.clear.pulse()

#### Bytes Column `bytes`

Outputs the raw bytes of the message in a separate column.

### Common Page

#### Language `language`

Select how the DAT decides which script language to operate on.

- **Input** `input` - The DAT uses the inputs script language.
- **Node** `node` - The DAT uses it's own script language.

#### Edit/View Extension `extension`

Select the file extension this DAT should expose to external editors.

- **dat** `dat` - various common file extensions.
- **From Language** `language` - pick extension from DATs script language.
- **Custom Extension** `custom` - Specify a custom extension.

#### Custom Extension `customext`

Specifiy the custom extension.

#### Word Wrap `wordwrap`

Enable Word Wrap for Node Display.

- **Input** `input` - The DAT uses the inputs setting.
- **On** `on` - Turn on Word Wrap.
- **Off** `off` - Turn off Word Wrap.

## Operator Inputs

- Input 0: -
- Input 1: -
