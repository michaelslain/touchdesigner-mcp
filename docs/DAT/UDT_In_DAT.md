# UDT In DAT

**Family:** DAT (Data Operator)

## Summary

NOTE This DAT has been removed from TouchDesigner 2021 Official builds and later.

The UDT In DAT is used for receiving information over a UDT connection between two remotely located computers. It captures all the messages without any queuing or buffering, and allows you to send it any messages you want. UDT Streaming is a reliable, streaming, connection orientated protocol. A single server can send to multiple clients at the same time.

Handle received messages using the callback DAT attached to the UDT In DAT. Send replies using the udtinDAT_Class.
