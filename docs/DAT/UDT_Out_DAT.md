# UDT Out DAT

**Family:** DAT (Data Operator)

## Summary

NOTE This DAT has been removed from TouchDesigner 2021 Official builds and later.

The UDT Out DAT is used for sending information over a UDT connection between remotely located computers.

Send messages using the udtoutDAT_Class. Handle received messages using the callback DAT attached to the UDT In DAT. See Network Protocols.

Although it is an 'Out' node, it can receive reply messages from the machine(s) it sends to. The messages will appear in the DAT's contents (just like the UDT In DAT).

Tscript uses the send Command to initiate the data output.

NOTE for Windows OS - If experiencing connection issues make sure Windows Firewall is disabled.
