# Lookup DAT

**Family:** DAT (Data Operator)

## Summary

The Lookup DAT outputs values from a lookup Table. The first input is an index into the second input.

The Lookup DAT allows you to select rows from its second input by referencing data either via row/column indices or row/column names. The advantage of the Lookup DAT is such that the order the data is selected is independent from the order in the Lookup Table, rather the Index Table dictates the order therefore allowing for reordering of data and selecting rows/columns multiple times.

## Parameters

### Lookup Page

#### Index `index`

Select how the index values are interpreted: as values/indices contained in a column or contained in a row.

- **Row Indices** `rowindices` - Rows selected in the Lookup DAT are represented as numerical indices in the Index input.
- **Col Indices** `colindices` - Columns selected in the Lookup DAT are represented as numerical indices in the Index input.
- **Row Values** `rowvalues` - Rows selected in the Lookup DAT are represented as values in the Index input. By default the first column is used to match the index but this can changed by setting the Value Location as well as Name or Index Parameter.
- **Col Values** `colvalues` - Columns selected in the Lookup DAT are represented as values in the Index input. By default the first row is used to match the index but this can changed by setting the Value Location as well as Name or Index Parameter.

#### Value Location `valueloction`

When 'Row Values' or 'Col Values' is selected in the Index Parameter, this parameter lets you select how the lookup row or column where the index value searches will be specified.

- **Name** `name` - The lookup row or column is specified by name.
- **Index** `index` - The lookup row or column is specified by index.

#### Value Name `valuename`

Specify the name of the lookup row or column.
