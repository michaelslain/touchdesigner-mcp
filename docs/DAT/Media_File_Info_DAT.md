# Media File Info DAT

**Family:** DAT (Data Operator)

## Summary

The Media File Info DAT encapsulates the essential metadata for a Media File. Metadata information like the codec, frame rate, audio sample rate, resolution etc is outputted.

A media file can be inputted to the DAT by either specifying the File path, or by referencing a Movie File In TOP or Audio File In CHOP.
