# JSON DAT

**Family:** DAT (Data Operator)

## Summary

The JSON DAT converts and filters JSON text using JSONPath syntax and outputs the filtered results. It eliminates having to code scripts to parse and manipulate JSON, and keeps the data flow procedural.

It expects JSON text as input and converts the input to a Python object in the DAT.source member.

It then filters the JSON down using the JSONPath Filter parameter, and it outputs the resulting data from the DAT as JSON text.

It also puts the filtered results as DAT.results (a Python list of results) and DAT.result (the first result).

You can test expressions on DAT.source, DAT.result and DAT.results by setting the Output menu to Expression and using expressions like me.result['city'], which outputs the evaluated expression from the DAT. You can then use that expression as op('json1').result['city'] in an expression elsewhere. DAT.expr is also a member of the JSON DAT, for example, op('json1').expr returns the evaluated expression parameter.

Output tables: The JSON DAT can output a table by setting the Output Format menu to Table. It will do its best to take the result of the JSON Filter and form rows and columns of values and headings in a DAT table. Any cell that can't be expressed as a simple string, integer, float or boolean will be left as the JSON string of the remainder. A cell or range of cells can be further reduced with a Select DAT and then passed to another JSON DAT which can convert the JSON strings to a table.

See also: JSONPath, OP Snippets, and the TDJSON functions for converting and manipulating JSON data.

## Parameters

### JSON Page

#### Filter `filter`

A filter string following JSONPath syntax that will be used to filter the input JSON.

#### Output `output`

Select the output of the JSON DAT.

- **Filter Result** `filterresult` - Outputs list returned from applying the filter to the JSON text input.
- **Expression** `expression` - Output a custom expression.

#### Expression `expression`

The custom expression to output

#### Output Format `outputformat`

Select the format of the DAT output.

- **None** `none` - No formatting done to the output, which essentially means it will be in a Python format (ie. with single quotes).
- **Indented** `indented` - Indent and convert single quotes to double quotes.
- **Table** `table` - Format the JSON output as a table. If the root structure is a list then it will be a column of values. If the root structure is a dictionary then it will have the first row as the name headers, and the next row as the value. If the output is a list of dictionaries then there will be multiple value rows below the name headers. In this case each row will represent a single dictionary structure in the list, and if that dictionary does not contain an entry for one of the names in the column header then it will be left blank.
- **Double Quotes** `doublequotes` - Convert single quotes to double quotes.

#### Hold Last Non-Empty Results `holdlast`

When enabled, the most recent result will be held if the results become empty, in effect only new non-empty results will update the output.

### Common Page

#### Language `language`

Select how the DAT decides which script language to operate on.

- **Input** `input` - The DAT uses the inputs script language.
- **Node** `node` - The DAT uses it's own script language.

#### Edit/View Extension `extension`

Select the file extension this DAT should expose to external editors.

- **dat** `dat` - various common file extensions.
- **frag** `frag`
- **glsl** `glsl`
- **html** `html`
- **md** `md`
- **py** `py`
- **rtf** `rtf`
- **tsv** `tsv`
- **txt** `txt`
- **vert** `vert`
- **xml** `xml`
- **From Language** `languageext` - pick extension from DATs script language.
- **Custom Extension** `customext` - Specify a custom extension.

#### Custom Extension `customext`

Specifiy the custom extension.

#### Word Wrap `wordwrap`

Enable Word Wrap for Node Display.

- **Input** `input` - The DAT uses the inputs setting.
- **On** `on` - Turn on Word Wrap.
- **Off** `off` - Turn off Word Wrap.

## Operator Inputs

- Input 0: - A JSON text input.
