# FIFO DAT

**Family:** DAT (Data Operator)

## Summary

The FIFO DAT maintains a user-set maximum number of rows in a table. You add rows using the appendRow() method found in DAT Class. When its capacity is reached, the first row is removed. After the maximum number of rows is reached, the oldest row is discarded when a new row is added.

Example:

## Parameters

### FIFO Page

#### Callbacks DAT `callbacks`

The Callbacks DAT will execute once for each row added to the FIFO DAT.

#### Execute from `executeloc`

Determines the location the script is run from.

- **Current Node** `current` - The script is executed from the current node location (for example, where 'cc' points to).
- **Callbacks DAT** `callbacks` - The script is executed from the location of the DAT specified in the Callbacks DAT parameter.
- **Specified Operator** `op` - The script is executed from the operator specified in the From Operator parameter below.

#### From Operator `fromop`

The operator whose state change will trigger the DAT to execute its script when Execute is set to Specified Operator. This operator is also the path that the script will be executed from if the Execute From parameter is set to Specified Operator.

#### Clamp Output `clamp`

The DAT is limited to 100 messages by default but with Clamp Output, this can be set to anything including unlimited.

#### Maximum Lines `maxlines`

Limits the number of messages, older messages are removed from the list first.

#### Clear Output `clear`
