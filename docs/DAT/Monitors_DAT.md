# Monitors DAT

**Family:** DAT (Data Operator)

## Summary

The Monitors DAT is a table of data about all currently detected monitors with information on the resolution, screen positioning, monitor name and description, GPU, and a flag indicating whether it is a primary monitor or not.

You can also set it to display the overall bounds of all the detected monitors.

It runs a callback script when a change in the monitors has been detected. These changes can be that a monitor was plugged in, a monitor was unplugged, the resolution of a monitor has changed, or the primary monitor has changed.

The Monitor DAT returns top/bottom values in lower-left origin coordinates, (0,0) is the lower-left corner of the monitor.
