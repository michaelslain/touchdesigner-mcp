# Script DAT

**Family:** DAT (Data Operator)

## Summary

The Script DAT runs a script each time the DAT cooks and can build/modify the output table based in the optional input tables. The Script DAT is created with a docked (attached) DAT that contains three Python methods: cook, onPulse, and setupParameters. The cook method is run each time the Script DAT cooks. The setupParameters method is run whenever the Setup Parameter button on the Script page is pressed. The onPulse method is run whenever a custom pulse parameter is pushed.

Refer to Help -> Python Examples, and Help -> Operator Snippets.

> **Note:** Because the Script DAT can get data from anywhere, it's difficult to determine what it procedurally depends on. So every time that any Script OP runs it will add to a list of operators, parameters, nodes etc that it depends upon, and when they change, the Script OP will re-cook. The list is reset when a .toe restarts.

## Parameters
