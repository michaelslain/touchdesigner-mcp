# DAT Execute DAT

**Family:** DAT (Data Operator)

## Summary

The DAT Execute DAT monitors another DAT's contents and runs a script when those contents change. The other DAT is usually a table.

DAT Execute DATs are created with default python method placeholders. For each monitored condition in the parameters, there is a matching python method in the DAT. When a condition is turned on in the parameters, each time that condition is satisfied the corresponding python method will be executed.

Note for 2025.30000 and later builds - A new onTableChange method does everything now, the other 4 legacy methods (onRowChange, onColChange, onCellChange, and onSizeChange) are now deprecated. DAT Execute DATs loaded from older builds will not have updated usage comments for the new onTableChange callback. You can get this information by created a new DAT Execute DAT in your network or from the code snippet below.

## Parameters

### DAT Execute Page

#### Active `active`

While on, the DAT will respond to the CHOP that is referenced.

#### Execute from `executeloc`

(Tscript only) Determines the location the script is run from.

- **Current Node** `current` - (Tscript only) The script is executed from the current node location.
- **This Node** `here` - The script is executed from the parent of the DAT. The DAT executes from the parent to make siblings of the DAT easy to access: DAT scripts used to execute from inside the DAT.
- **Specified Operator** `op` - The script is executed from the operator specified in the From Operator parameter below.

#### From Operator `fromop`

(Tscript only) The path that the script will be executed from if the Execute From parameter is set to Specified Operator.

#### DAT `dat`

The DAT which is monitored and will trigger the script to execute when its contents change.

#### Table Change `tablechange`

The onTableChange() method is called if the table changes in any way since the last cook.

#### Row Change `rowchange`

Deprecated, use onTableChange() now. The onRowChange() method is called once for every row that changed (since its last cook).

#### Column Change `colchange`

Deprecated, use onTableChange() now. The onColChange() method is called once for every column that changed (since its last cook).

#### Cell Change `cellchange`

Deprecated, use onTableChange() now. The onCellChange() method is called for every cell that changed since the last cook.

#### Size Change `sizechange`

Deprecated, use onTableChange() now. The onSizeChange() method is called for every table size change since the last cook.

#### Execute `execute`

Determines if the methods are executed at the start of the frame or end of the frame.

- **Start of Frame** `start` - The method will be called from the start of the frame. If a row changes 4 times during a frame then the method will run 4 times as well (useful for Multi Touch In DAT events for example).
- **End of Frame** `end` - The method will execute at most one time per frame, at the end of the frame, even if it triggered several times in one frame. If, for example, Monitor is set to Row, a row may change several times in a frame, but it will be called only once for each row.

#### Edit.. `edit`

Clicking this opens a text editor to edit text in the DAT.

### File Page

#### File `file`

The filesystem path and name of the file to load. Accepts .txt and .dat files.

#### Sync to File `syncfile`

When On, loads the file from disk into the DAT when the projects starts. A filename must be specified. Turning on the option will load the file from disk immediately. If the file does not exist, it will be created the first time the DAT is updated. The file is monitored so that any changes made to the file will update the DAT, and any changes made to the DAT will be written to the file right away. If the file is removed, the DAT will retain its current contents.

#### Load on Start `loadonstart`

When On, reloads the file from disk into the DAT when the projects starts.

#### Load File `loadonstartpulse`

Instantly reloads the file.

#### Write on Toe Save `write`

When On, writes the contents of the DAT out to the file on disk when the project is saved.

#### Write File `writepulse`

Instantly write the file to disk.

### Common Page

#### Language `language`

Select how the DAT decides which script language to operate on.

- **Input** `input` - The DAT uses the inputs script language.
- **Node** `node` - The DAT uses it's own script language.

#### Edit/View Extension `extension`

Select the file extension this DAT should expose to external editors.

- **dat** `dat` - various common file extensions.
- **From Language** `language` - pick extension from DATs script language.
- **Custom Extension** `custom` - Specify a custom extension.

#### Custom Extension `customext`

Specifiy the custom extension.

#### Word Wrap `wordwrap`

Enable Word Wrap for Node Display.

- **Input** `input` - The DAT uses the inputs setting.
- **On** `on` - Turn on Word Wrap.
- **Off** `off` - Turn off Word Wrap.

## Operator Inputs

- Input 0: -
