# Keyboard In DAT

**Family:** DAT (Data Operator)

## Summary

The Keyboard In DAT lists the most recent key events in its FIFO (first in/first out) table. There is one row for every key press down and every key-up, including Shift, Ctrl and Alt, with distinction between left and right side. For convenience, with each key press, a column indicates if the Shift, Ctrl and Alt were being held down at the time.

You get key presses even of the cursor is outside the TouchDesigner windows, whether they are control panels, Perform Mode or the network editor window. Exceptions: while entering text in the editor window.

You can set a filter to watch only certain keys. Custom shortcuts can be defined and handled by a python callback in the attached script.

## Parameters

### Keyboard In Page

#### Active `active`

Inhibits and allows message to be added to log.

#### Perform Window Only `perform`

When on, key events are only detected while in perform mode.

#### Keys `keys`

List of keys to allow through the filter. Just put the characters in the list, space-separated. Eg. '1 2 g h' for the 1, 2, g and h keys. Only these keys will be added to the log and generate an event. If blank, no filtering will be done. List of accepted keys: Keyboard UI

#### Shortcuts `shortcuts`

List of shortcuts to watch for. See "Shortcuts" in the notes for defining shortcuts.

#### Panels `panels`

Optional list of references to panels to detect events from. Events will only be fired when any of the listed panels has focus.

#### Left/Right Modifiers `lrmodifiers`

When on, the states of the left and right modifier keys (see Notes) will be added to the table. Switching the state of this parameter will reset the table's contents.

### Log Page

#### Callbacks DAT `callbacks`

Path to a DAT containing callbacks for each keyboard event received. See keyboardinDAT_Class for usage.

#### Execute from `executeloc`

Determines the location the script is run from.

- **Current Node** `current` - The script is executed from the current node location (for example, where 'cc' points to).
- **Callbacks DAT** `callbacks`
- **Specified Operator** `op` - The script is executed from the operator specified in the From Operator parameter below.

#### From Operator `fromop`

The operator whose state change will trigger the DAT to execute its script when Execute is set to Specified Operator. This operator is also the path that the script will be executed from if the Execute From parameter is set to Specified Operator.

#### Clamp Output `clamp`

The DAT is limited to 100 messages by default but with Clamp Output, this can be set to anything including unlimited.

#### Maximum Lines `maxlines`

Limits the number of messages, older messages are removed from the list first.
