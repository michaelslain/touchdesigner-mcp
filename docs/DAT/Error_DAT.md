# Error DAT

**Family:** DAT (Data Operator)

## Summary

The Error DAT lists the most recent TouchDesigner errors in its FIFO (first in/first out) table.

You can filter our messages using pattern matching on some of the columns like Severity, Type and path of the node containing the error. One column contains the absolute frame (absTime.frame) in which the error occurred.

## Parameters

### Error Page

#### Active `active`

Inhibits and allows message to be added to log.

#### Severity `severity`

Filter pattern for the output. Can be a combination or one of: message, warning or abort

#### Type `type`

Filter pattern for the output where the source operator family is specified. Can be a combination or one of the operator families.

#### Source `source`

Filter pattern for the output where the logging of errors can be limited to specific locations in the project.

#### Message `message`

Filter pattern for the output applied to the error message.

#### Log Current Errors `logcurrent`

### Log Page

#### Callbacks DAT `callbacks`

The DAT's script will execute once for each message coming in. See errorDAT_Class for usage.

#### Execute from `executeloc`

Determines the location the script is run from.

- **Current Node** `current` - The script is executed from the current node location.
- **Callbacks DAT** `callbacks` - The script is executed from the location of the DAT specified in the Callbacks DAT parameter.
- **Specified Operator** `op` - The script is executed from the operator specified in the From Operator parameter below.

#### From Operator `fromop`
