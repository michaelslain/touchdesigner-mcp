# CPlusPlus DAT

**Family:** DAT (Data Operator)

## Summary

The CPlusPlus DAT allows you to make custom DAT operators by writing your own plugin using C++.

Using the CPlusPlus DAT, you can create either a Table or Text DAT output depending what type you specify at the time of creation. See Write a CPlusPlus Plugin and the other articles in the C++ category for more detailed information on how to make .dll for use with this DAT. Note that regardless of the type of DAT node (i.e. Table or Text), all the names for searching the cells and assigned texts have to be a encoded as a valid UTF-8.

Example for CPlusPlus DAT as a Visual Studio project in Windows are available in C:/Program Files/Derivative/TouchDesigner/Samples/CPlusPlus/DAT or your custom TouchDesigner installation folder. (NOTE: On macOS it is here: TouchDesigner.app/Contents/Resources/tfs/Samples/CPlusPlus/DAT

Custom Parameters - Custom Parameters can be automatically created by the C++ DAT .dll. This custom parameter page can be removed, edited, or appended to from within the setupParameters() function in CPlusPlusDATExample.cpp. The defined custom parameters can be enabled or disabled depending on whether they are valid for a specific task or not.)
