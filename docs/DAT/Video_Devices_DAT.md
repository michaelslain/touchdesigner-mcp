# Video Devices DAT

**Family:** DAT (Data Operator)

## Summary

The Video Devices DAT provides information about all detected video devices including driver, direction (input or output), label, and name that can be referenced in the Video Device In TOP and Video Device Out TOP.

You can also set it to display all available video devices.

It runs a callback script when a change in video devices has been detected and returns a list of names corresponding to the changed devices.

The 'name' column is a unique identifier for the device that is built up using a few pieces. The pieces are separated using ||| as a delimiter E.g V1|||83514832|||0|||0|||DeckLink 8K Pro (1) Which splits up into: Name Version Number ||| Unique Device ID ||| Device Index ||| Device Sub Index ||| Device Label Where: Name Version Number - If the format of this name changes in the future, this will allow future versions know how to parse this. For now it's always set to V1. Device Unique ID - A unique ID obtained for the device, when possible. Sometimes it's serial number, sometimes it's based on the PCIe port is connected to. Some manufacturers such as Blackmagic assign a different ID to each connector, while others such as AJA have one ID for the entire card, and the extra connectors are differentiated via the 'Device Sub Index' field. Device Index - The index of the device, in the order it was enumerated from the driver. Device Sub Index - Within a device, the connectors may be referenced by a sub-index, which would change here. Device Label - An English-readable label for the device. Usually unique by adding extra (#) and - # suffixes to differentiate between identical devices.

Unlike most menus, the contents of the string the menu is set to does not need to be an exact match to the devices available on the system. This is done to allow falling back to other devices when a project moves from one machine to another. It will first try to find devices that match using both 'Device Unique ID' and 'Device Sub Index'. If there are no devices on the system that match both of those it will then try to match using both 'Device Label' and 'Device Sub Index'. If there are still no matches, it will finally try to match using both 'Device Index' and 'Device Sub Index'.
