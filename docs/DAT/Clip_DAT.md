# Clip DAT

**Family:** DAT (Data Operator)

## Summary

The Clip DAT contains information about motion clips that are manipulated by a Clip CHOP and Clip Blender CHOP. The Clip DAT can hold any command or script text, which can be triggered based on the settings on the Execute parameter page (This is where the Clip DAT and the Text DAT are different). The Clip DAT's script is triggered by specified clips being played through a Clip Blender CHOP.

## Parameters

### Text Page

#### Edit.. `edit`

Clicking this opens a text editor to add/edit/delete text from the DAT.

#### File `file`

The path and name of the file to load. Accepts .txt and .dat files. The file can be read in from disk or from the web. Use http:// when specifying a URL.

#### Reload File `reload`

When set to 1, reloads the file into the DAT.

### Execute Page

#### Execute from `executeloc`

Determines the location the script is run from.

- **Current Node** `current` - The script is executed from the current node location.
- **This Node** `here` - The script is executed from the Text DAT itself.
- **Specified Component** `comp` - The script is executed from the component specified in the Component parameter below.

#### Clip `clip`

Points to the Clip CHOP which will trigger the script when run in a Clip Blender CHOP.

#### Component `component`

The path that the script will be executed from if the Execute From parameter is set to Specified Component.

#### Execute on Frame (First) `framefirst`

Executes the script once, the first time the specified index of the clip is played in a clipblender. Even if the clip is looping in a clipblender, the script will only be executed once.

#### Execute on Frame (Loop) `frameloop`

Executes the script everytime the specified index of the clip is played in a clipblender. When a clip is looping, the script will run each time through the loop.

#### Execute on Exit `exit`

Executes the script when a clipblender exits the specified clip.

#### Print State `printstate`

Print debug information to the textport.

### Common Page
