# Copy SOP

**Family:** SOP (Surface Operator)

## Summary

The Copy SOP lets you make copies of the geometry of other SOPs and apply a transformation to each copy.

It also allows you to copy geometry to points on an input template.

## Parameters

### Copy Page

#### Source Group `sourcegrp`

Specifies a subset of input primitives to copy from. Accepts patterns, as described in Pattern Matching.

#### Template Group `templategrp`

Specifies a subset of template primitives from which to copy onto. Accepts patterns, as described in Pattern Matching.

#### Number of Copies `ncy`

Sets number of Copies to be made of the source. For a template input, it specifies the number of copies to be placed at each point of the template.

#### Primitives per Point `nprims`

Defines how many primitives to copy from each point.

#### Rotate to Normal `nml`

Only used when a template input is specified. If the template is a sphere, and the first input is a circle, a circle is placed at each point of the sphere. With this option on, all the circles will re-orient to face the surface of the sphere (a default sphere has normals radiating outwards from the center).

#### Transform Cumulative `cum`

Each transformation "builds" on the location left by the one before it. Transformations are cumulative as the Copy SOP produces new copies.

#### Transform Order `xord`

Sets the overall transform order for the transformations. The Transform Order determines the order in which transformations take place. Depending on the order, you can achieve different results using the exact same values. Choose the appropriate order from the menu.

- **Scale Rotate Translate** `srt`
- **Scale Translate Rotate** `str`
- **Rotate Scale Translate** `rst`
- **Rotate Translate Scale** `rts`
- **Translate Scale Rotate** `tsr`
- **Translate Rotate Scale** `trs`

#### Rotate Order `rord`

Sets the order of the rotations within the overall transform order.

- **Rx Ry Rz** `xyz`
- **Rx Rz Ry** `xzy`
- **Ry Rx Rz** `yxz`
- **Ry Rz Rx** `yzx`
- **Rz Rx Ry** `zxy`
- **Rz Ry Rx** `zyx`

#### Translate `t`

These allow you to specify the Translation (how much it moves over in a given direction), Rotation, and the Scale between each copy. Three columns are given for X, Y, and Z coordinates. Guide geometry is provided for the Pivot's translations. The Pivot is represented by a single red dot in the Viewport. Changing the Pivot parameters moves this point of reference.

- **X** `tx`
- **Y** `ty`
- **Z** `tz`

#### Rotate `r`

These allow you to specify the Translation (how much it moves over in a given direction), Rotation, and the Scale between each copy. Three columns are given for X, Y, and Z coordinates. Guide geometry is provided for the Pivot's translations. The Pivot is represented by a single red dot in the Viewport. Changing the Pivot parameters moves this point of reference.

- **X** `rx`
- **Y** `ry`
- **Z** `rz`

#### Scale `s`

These allow you to specify the Translation (how much it moves over in a given direction), Rotation, and the Scale between each copy. Three columns are given for X, Y, and Z coordinates. Guide geometry is provided for the Pivot's translations. The Pivot is represented by a single red dot in the Viewport. Changing the Pivot parameters moves this point of reference.

- **X** `sx`
- **Y** `sy`
- **Z** `sz`

#### Pivot `p`

These allow you to specify the Translation (how much it moves over in a given direction), Rotation, and the Scale between each copy. Three columns are given for X, Y, and Z coordinates. Guide geometry is provided for the Pivot's translations. The Pivot is represented by a single red dot in the Viewport. Changing the Pivot parameters moves this point of reference.

- **X** `px`
- **Y** `py`
- **Z** `pz`

#### Uniform Scale `scale`

Uniform Scale allows you to shrink or enlarge geometry along all three axes simultaneously.

#### Normals Maintain Length `vlength`

Vector type attributes (i.e. normals, velocity) maintain the same length under transforms. i.e. When geometry is scaled, the normals remain constant in length.

#### Create Output Groups `newg`

If selected, this creates a group for each copy number, and places each primitive created at that stage into it.

#### Copy Groups `copyg`

Defines the base name of the groups created.

#### Look At `lookat`

Orients the copied geometry to lookat, or point to, the object component specified in the parameter.

#### Up Vector `upvector`

When specifying a Look At, it is possible to specify an up vector for the lookat. Without using an up vector, it is possible to get poor animation when the lookat object passes through the Y axis of the target object.

- **X** `upvectorx`
- **Y** `upvectory`
- **Z** `upvectorz`

### Stamp Page

#### Stamp Inputs `stamp`

When enabled, it will Stamp proceeding variables for each input copied.

#### Copy `copy`

Sequence of stamp variables Param copy0param - Token of each stamp variable. Stamped parameters are accessible via the global fetchStamp() method in the td Module in python, or param() in tscript. See the example, below. Value copy0value - Value of each stamp variable. Stamped parameters are accessible via the global fetchStamp() method in the td Module in python, or param() in tscript. See the example, below.

## Info CHOP Channels

Extra Information for the Copy SOP can be accessed via an Info CHOP.

### Common SOP Info Channels
- num_points - Number of points in this SOP.
- num_prims - Number of primitives in this SOP.
- num_particles - Number of particles in this SOP.
- last_vbo_update_time - Time spent in another thread updating geometry data on the GPU from the SOP's CPU data. As it is part of another thread, this time is not part of the usual frame time.
- last_meta_vbo_update_time - Time spent in another thread updating meta surface geometry data (such as metaballs or nurbs) on the GPU from the SOP's CPU data. As it is part of another thread, this time is not part of the usual frame time.

### Common Operator Info Channels

- cook_time - Duration of the last cook in milliseconds.
- cook_frame - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the component timeline.
- cook_abs_frame - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the absolute time.
