# Arm SOP

**Family:** SOP (Surface Operator)

## Summary

The Arm SOP creates all the necessary geometry for an arm, and provides a smooth, untwisted skin that connects the arm to the body. It is controlled through inverse kinematics linked to a handprint.

> **Note:** If the channel is set to 0, then the hand rotations are relative to the forearm. If the channel is set to 1, the hand rotations are the same orientation as the end affector.

## Parameters

### Arm Page

#### Capture Type `capttype`

You can use either Ellipses or Capture Regions as deformation geometry. Ellipses are for use with the Skeleton SOP. Capture Regions are for use with the Capture SOP.

- **Ellipses** `ellipses`
- **Capture Regions** `cregions`

#### Arm Axis `axis`

Position the model along the +X or -X axis.

- **+ X** `posx`
- **- X** `negx`

#### Radius `bonerad`

Controls the scale of the circle radii.

#### Rotate Hand `rotatehand`

This parameter rotates the hand and the wrist joint to match the orientation of the hand-print object. In order to operate correctly, the end-affector (hand print) scale transformations must remain at 1.

#### Auto Elbow Twist `autoelbow`

This parameter affects the default twist of the elbow joint to a more natural position.
