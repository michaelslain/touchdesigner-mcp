# Point SOP

**Family:** SOP (Surface Operator)

## Summary

The Point SOP allows you to get right into the geometry and manipulate the position, color, texture coordinates, and normals of the points in the Source, and other attributes. The Point SOP also lets you create custom point attributes. It is the complement to the Primitive SOP. Using a second input allows for combining of two SOPs using their respective expressions (see: PointSOP Class). If the second input has less points than the first input, the points in the second input will be cycled.

For example, you can create point coloring, or flip the normals of incoming geometry. Using expressions in Position X, Y and Z, you can move any given input point to a new place as defined by the expression with any standard attributes.

The Width (width) attribute affects the line width in the Line MAT. The Scale attribute (pscale) affects particle size, and in the Line MAT it affects the dot size at each point.

> **Tip:** For greater flexibility, use the Script SOP.

> **Note:** When edge forces are added using the Point SOP, the force directions are computed in the Point SOP itself. Thus, any following transformations do not effect these. If you wish for the edge directions to be transformed as well, all transformations must be done before the Point SOP. Only the edge forces function like this.

## Parameters

### Point Page

#### Group `group`

If there are input groups, specifying a group name in this field will cause this SOP to act only upon the group specified. Accepts patterns, as described in Pattern Matching.

#### Position `t`

Expressions to translate the XYZ coordinates of a given point can be entered here. The attributes to modify here are: me.inputPoint.x, me.inputPoint.y and me.inputPoint.z. Simply entering me.inputPoint.x into the Position X field means that the X coordinate of each point that comes in is passed straight through with no modification. Changing this entry to me.inputPoint.x+5 means that the X coordinate of each point that comes in will be displaced by 5 units. This expression can be expanded to produce many useful effects. Transformations can also be effected in the Y and Z fields.

- **Position** `tx`
- **Position** `ty`
- **Position** `tz`

#### Weight `doweight`

Select between keeping the weight or adding a new weight.

#### Edge F `doedgef`

Retains, adds, or removes edgef attributes for points, which only works on primitive face types. The force is directed in the direction of the edge leading from that point. If multiple vertices reference the same point, then the direction is the edge direction of the last primitive referencing the point. If the face open, then the end point has an edge direction equal to that of the preceding point in that primitive. Note: When edge forces are added using the Point SOP, the force directions are computed in the Point SOP itself. Thus, any following transformations do not effect these. If you wish for the edge directions to be transformed as well, all transformations must be done before the Point SOP. Only the edge forces function like this.
