# Limit SOP

**Family:** SOP (Surface Operator)

## Summary

The Limit SOP creates geometry from samples fed to it by CHOPs. It creates geometry at every point in the sample. Different types of geometry can be created using the Output Type parameter on the Channels Page.

> **Note:** If using a Copy SOP, turn on the Use Template Point Attributes option in the Copy SOP's Attributes Page to allow the geometry to inherit the point attributes.

#### Texture W `texturew`

Controls the w texture-offset for the point(s) This is most often used as a frame-offset or time-offset, expressed in # of frames from the current frame or frame 1 of an image sequence.

### Custom Page

#### Custom Attribute `customattr`

Sequence of custom attributes to be added to the geometry created. Name customattr0name - Specify the name of the custom attribute, for example pscale, age, or any custom name. Channel Zero customattr0chan0 - Select which channel to assign to the [0] index of the attribute. ie. pscale[0] Channel One customattr0chan1 - Select which channel to assign to the [1] index of the attribute. ie. pscale[1] Channel Two customattr0chan2 - Select which channel to assign to the [2] index of the attribute. ie. pscale[2] Channel Three customattr0chan3 - Select which channel to assign to the [3] index of the attribute. ie. pscale[3]

### Output Page

#### Output Type `output`

The type of geometry the Limit SOP produces from its sample data.

- **Polygonal Line** `line` - Creates a point for each sample and connects them with a polygonal line.
- **Polygon at Each Point** `polys` - Places a polygon at each sample point. Number of points in polygon defined by Divisions.
- **Primitive Circle at Each Point** `circles` - Places a primitive circle at each sample point.
- **Sphere at Each Point** `spheres` - Places a primitive sphere at each smaple point.
- **Poly Sphere at Each Point** `polyspheres` - Places a polygonal sphere at each sample point. Sphere's frequency defined by Divisions.
- **Tubes** `tubes` - Creates a tube down the path. Tubes cross-section defined by Divisions.
- **Strips** `strips` - Creates a strip down the path. Number of points in strip defined by Divisions.

#### Divisions `divisions`

Only works on the following Output Types. Polygon at Each Point - Number of points per polygon. Poly Sphere at Each Point - Frequency of each Polygonal Sphere. Tubes - Number of points in cross-section of the tube. Strips - Number of points in cross-section of the strip.

#### Radius `rad`

Radius of geometry created. Disabled for "Polygonal Line".

#### Smooth Flip `flipsmooth`

Dynamically controls the twist of each instance of geometry on a series of points to avoid frame-by-frame flipping, which can sometimes occur when geometry is oriented along a path.

#### Limit `dolimit`

Creates a bounding box for the position of the output geometry. Drop down menu determines behavior when outside bounded region.

- **Off** `off` - Bounding region off.
- **Clamp** `clamp` - Clamps position to specified value.
- **Loop** `loop` - Loops position between bounded region.
- **Zigzag** `zigzag` - Zigzags position back and forth between bounded region.

#### X Limit `xlimit`

Parameters to set edges of bounding region when Limit is active.

- **xlimitmin** `xlimitmin`
- **xlimitmax** `xlimitmax`

#### Y Limit `ylimit`

Parameters to set edges of bounding region when Limit is active.

- **ylimitmin** `ylimitmin`
- **ylimitmax** `ylimitmax`

#### Z Limit `zlimit`

Parameters to set edges of bounding region when Limit is active.

- **zlimitmin** `zlimitmin`
- **zlimitmax** `zlimitmax`

#### Apply Texture `texture`

Applys u, v, and w texture coordinates to the created geometry.

#### Scale `texscale`

Scales the texture coordinates a specific amount.

- **texscale1** `texscale1`
- **texscale2** `texscale2`

#### Offset `texoffset`

Offsets the texture coordinates a specific amount.

- **texoffset1** `texoffset1`
- **texoffset2** `texoffset2`

#### Orient to Path `orient`

If this option is selected, the object will be oriented along the path. To see what the path looks like, change the Output Type to "Polygonal Line". When the Output Type is "Polygon/Primitive Circle at Each Point", the positive Z axis of each object will be pointing down the path. When the Output Type is "Tubes/Strips" then the cross-section of the geometry created will be pointing down the path.

#### Lookat Object `lookat`

Orient to Path must be checked for Lookat Object to have any effect. This allows you to orient your geometry by naming the object you would like it to Look At, or point to. Once you have designated this object to look at, it will continue to face that object, even if you move it. The Look At parameter points the each piece of geometry at the other object's origin individually.

#### Rotate Polys `dorotate`

Rotate the geometry at each point using the Rotate parameter (below). Only works for Output Type is "Polygon/Primitive Circle at Each Point".

- **Off** `off` - Do not rotate polys. Rotate parameter is greyed out.
- **On** `on` - Add value of Rotate to polys equally.
- **Cumulative** `cum` - Add value of Rotate to polys cumulatively (ie. increasing with each poly).

#### Rotate `rotate`

Rotation channels rx, ry, and rz for Rotate Polys parameter.

- **X** `rotatex`
- **Y** `rotatey`
- **Z** `rotatez`

#### Compute Normals `normals`

Computes normals for the geometry created.
