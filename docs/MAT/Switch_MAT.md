# Switch MAT

**Family:** MAT (Material Operator)

## Summary

The Switch MAT allows you to switch between multiple materials.

## Parameters

### Switch Page

#### Index `index`

Selects which input to use. The first input is 0.

#### Extend `extend`

Determines extend behaviour when index is out of range. Allows negative indices.

- **Clamp** `clamp`
- **Loop** `loop`
- **ZigZag** `zigzag`

### Deform Page

#### Deform `dodeform`

Enables deforms on this material.

#### Get Bone Data: `deformdata`

Specifies where the deform bone data will be obtained.

- **From a SOP** `sop`
- **From another MAT** `mat`
- **From a DeformIn MAT** `deformin`

#### SOP with Capture Data `targetsop`

Specifies the SOP that contains the deform capture attributes.

#### pCaptPath Attrib `pcaptpath`

Specifies the name of the pCaptPath attribute to use. When your geometry has been put through a Bone Group SOP, the attributes will be split into names like pCaptPath0, pCaptPath1. You can only render 1 bone group at a time, so this should match the group you are rendering with this material.

#### pCaptData Attrib `pcaptdata`

Much like pCaptPath Attrib.

#### Skeleton Root Path `skelrootpath`

Specifies the path to the COMP where the root of the skeleton is located.

#### MAT `mat`

When obtaining deform data from a MAT or a Deform In MAT, this is where that MAT is specified.

### Common Page

#### Blending(Transparency) `blending`

This toggle enables and disables blending. However see the wiki article Transparency.

#### Source Color * `srcblend`

This value is multiplied by the color value of the pixel that is being written to the Color-Buffer (also know as the Source Color).

- **Zero** `zero`
- **Dest Color** `dcol`
- **One Minus Dest Color** `omdcol`
- **Source Alpha** `sa`
- **One Minus Source Alpha** `omsa`
- **Dest Alpha** `da`
- **One Minus Dest Alpha** `omda`
- **Source Alpha Saturate** `sas`
- **One** `one`

#### Destination Color * `destblend`

This value is multiplied by the color value of the pixel currently in the Color-Buffer (also known as the Destination Color).

- **One** `one`
- **Src Color** `scol`
- **One Minus Src Color** `omscol`
- **Source Alpha** `sa`
- **One Minus Source Alpha** `omsa`
- **Dest Alpha** `da`
- **One Minus Dest Alpha** `omda`
- **Zero** `zero`

#### Separate Alpha Function `separatealphafunc`

This toggle enables and disables separate blending options for the alpha values.

#### Source Alpha * `srcblenda`

This value is multiplied by the alpha value of the pixel that is being written to the Color-Buffer (also know as the Source Alpha).

- **Zero** `zero`
- **Dest Color** `dcol`
- **One Minus Dest Color** `omdcol`
- **Source Alpha** `sa`
- **One Minus Source Alpha** `omsa`
- **Dest Alpha** `da`
- **One Minus Dest Alpha** `omda`
- **Source Alpha Saturate** `sas`
- **One** `one`

#### Destination Alpha * `destblenda`

This value is multiplied by the alpha value of the pixel currently in the Color-Buffer (also known as the Destination Alpha).

- **One** `one`
- **Src Color** `scol`
- **One Minus Src Color** `omscol`
- **Source Alpha** `sa`
- **One Minus Source Alpha** `omsa`
- **Dest Alpha** `da`
- **One Minus Dest Alpha** `omda`
- **Zero** `zero`

#### Depth Test `depthtest`

Enables and disables the Depth-Test. If the depth-test is disabled, depths values aren't written to the Depth-Buffer.

#### Depth Test Function `depthfunc`

The depth value of the pixel being drawn is compared to the depth value currently in the depth-buffer using this function. If the test passes then the pixel is drawn to the Frame-Buffer. If the test fails the pixel is discarded and no changes are made to the Frame-Buffer.

- **Less Than** `less`
- **Less Than or Equal** `lessorequal`
- **Equal** `equal`
- **Greater Than** `greater`
- **Greater Than or Equal** `greaterorequal`
- **Not Equal** `notequal`
- **Always** `always`

#### Write Depth Values `depthwriting`

If Write Depth Values is on, pixels that pass the depth-test will write their depth value to the Depth-Buffer. If this isn't on then no changes will be made to the Depth-Buffer, regardless of if the pixels drawn pass or fail the depth-test.

#### Discard Pixels Based on Alpha `alphatest`

This enables or disables the pixel alpha test.

#### Keep Pixels with Alpha `alphafunc`

This menu works in conjunction with the Alpha Threshold parameter below in determining which pixels to keep based on their alpha value.

- **Less Than** `less`
- **Less Than or Equal** `lessorequal`
- **Greater Than** `greater`
- **Greater Than or Equal** `greaterorequal`

#### Alpha Threshold `alphathreshold`

This value is what the pixel's alpha is compared to to determine if the pixel should be drawn. Pixels with alpha greater than the Alpha Threshold will be drawn. Pixels with alpha less than or equal to the Alpha Threshold will not be drawn.

#### Wire Frame `wireframe`

Enables and disables wire-frame rendering with the option of OpenGL Tesselated or Topology based wireframes.

- **Off** `off`
- **OpenGL Tesselated Wire Frame** `tesselated`
- **Topology Wire Frame** `topology`

#### Line Width `wirewidth`

This value is the width that the wires will be. This value is in pixels.

#### Cull Face `cullface`

Selects which faces to render.

- **Use Render Setting** `userender` - Use the render settings found in the Render or Render Pass TOP.
- **Neither** `neither` - Do not cull any faces, render everything.
- **Back Faces** `backfaces` - Cull back faces, render front faces.
- **Front Faces** `frontfaces` - Cull front faces, render back faces.
- **Both Faces** `bothfaces` - Cull both faces, render nothing.

#### Polygon Depth Offset `polygonoffset`

Turns on the polygon offset feature.

#### Offset Factor `polygonoffsetfactor`

#### Offset Units `polygonoffsetunits`

## Operator Inputs

- Input 0: -

## Info CHOP Channels

Extra Information for the Switch MAT can be accessed via an Info CHOP.
