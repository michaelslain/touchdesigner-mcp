# Lag CHOP

**Family:** CHOP (Channel Operator)

## Summary

The Lag CHOP adds lag and overshoot to channels. It can also limit the velocity and acceleration of channels. Lag slows down rapid changes in the input channels. Overshoot amplifies the changes in the input channels.

Two values exist for each parameter. For example, in the Lag effect, when the input channel value is rising, the first lag parameter is used, and when the channel value is decreasing, the second lag parameter is used. This can give a quick rise, and a slow fall. But lag up and down are often kept at the same value.

For a similar, less-abrupt effect, see the Filter CHOP.

## Parameters

### Lag Page

#### Method `lagmethod`

The method by which lag is applied to the channels.

- **Lag Value** `value` - Up is defined as an increase in values of the input channels, and down is a decrease in values of the inputs.
- **Lag Amplitude** `amp` - Up is defined as an increase in amplitude (moving away from zero) and down is defined as a decrease in amplitude (moving towards zero) of each input channel.
- **Lag Magnitude** `mag` - All the input channels are treated as components of one vector, and each operation is applied to the vector as a whole. Only the first parameter in Lag, Overshoot, Clamp Slope and Clamp Acceleration applies in this mode.
- **Quaternion Rotation (Commercial)** `rotation` - Allows the lag to work with quaternion rotations.

#### Lag `lag`

Applies a lag to a channel. The first value is for lagging up, and the second is for lagging down. It is approximately the time that the output follows 90% of a change to the input.

- **lag1** `lag1` - Lagging up value.
- **lag2** `lag2` - Lagging down value.

#### Lag Unit `lagunit`

Choose between using Samples, Frames, or Seconds as the units for this parameter.

#### Overshoot `overshoot`

Applies overshoot to a channel. The first value is for overshoot while moving up, and the second is for overshoot while moving down.

- **overshoot1** `overshoot1`
- **overshoot2** `overshoot2`

#### Overshoot Unit `overshootunit`

Choose between using Samples, Frames, or Seconds as the units for this parameter.

#### Clamp Slope `clamp`

Clamps the slope (or velocity) to lie between the values listed in Max Slope below. Slope is expressed as value/Units.

#### Max Slope `slope`

The first value limits the slope when it is rising, and the second value limits the slope when it is decreasing.

- **slope1** `slope1`
- **slope2** `slope2`

#### Clamp Acceleration `aclamp`

Clamps the acceleration to lie between the values listed in Max Acceleration below. Acceleration is expressed as value/(Units*2) .

#### Max Acceleration `accel`

The first value limits the acceleration when it is rising, and the second value limits the acceleration when it is decreasing.

- **accel1** `accel1`
- **accel2** `accel2`

#### Lag per Sample `lagsamples`

Applies the lag to each sample of the channel instead of across the whole channel. Useful for working with multi-sample channels.

#### Snap `snap`

When On, if the difference between the output lag value and the input CHOP's value is within the specified threshold, the output value gets snapped to be equal to the input value.

#### Threshold `threshold`

The threshold value for snapping the output to the input.

#### Reset `reset`

When On resets (bypasses) the lag effect.

#### Reset Pulse `resetpulse`

Instantly resets the lag effect.

### Common Page

#### Time Slice `timeslice`

Turning this on forces the channels to be "Time Sliced". A Time Slice is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.

#### Scope `scope`

To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a Scope string on the Common page. See Pattern Matching.

#### Sample Rate Match `srselect`

Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or "Linear" if the Interpolate Options are not available.

- **Resample At First Input's Rate** `first` - Use rate of first input to resample others.
- **Resample At Maximum Rate** `max` - Resample to the highest sample rate.
- **Resample At Minimum Rate** `min` - Resample to the lowest sample rate.
- **Error If Rates Differ** `err` - Doesn't accept conflicting sample rates.

#### Export Method `exportmethod`

This will determine how to connect the CHOP channel to the parameter. Refer to the Export article for more information.

- **DAT Table by Index** `datindex` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the index of the channel in the CHOP.
- **DAT Table by Name** `datname` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the name of the channel in the CHOP.
- **Channel Name is Path:Parameter** `autoname` - The channel is the full destination of where to export to, such has .

#### Export Root `autoexportroot`

This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by Channel Name is Path:Parameter are relative to.

#### Export Table `exporttable`

The DAT used to hold the export information when using the DAT Table Export Methods (See above).

#### Rename from `commonrenamefrom`

The channel pattern to rename. See Pattern Matching.

#### Rename to `commonrenameto`

The replacement pattern for the names. The default parameters do not rename the channels. See Pattern Replacement. Example: Channel Names: c[1-10:2] ambient Rename From: c* ambient Rename To: b[1-5] ambThis example fetches channels c1 c3 c5 c7 c9 and ambient. They are then renamed to to b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 and amb.
