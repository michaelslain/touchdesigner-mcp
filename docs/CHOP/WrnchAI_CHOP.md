# WrnchAI CHOP

**Family:** CHOP (Channel Operator)

## Summary

Using the wrnchAI engine to track human motion in any video stream, this CHOP will output channels for Body, Face and Hand positions. Multiple people can be tracked at the same time with low-latency, and the system compatible with all cameras and video feeds. TouchDesigner used the wrnchAI Edge SDK and all computation is done locally in realtime utilizing Nvidia GPUs and the NVIDIA CUDA® Deep Neural Network library (cuDNN). This can offer skeletal tracking of multiple people at 60fps or higher (90-120fps etc).

Once you have a wrnchAI license (purchased or trial), you will have access to your wrnchAI licenses page and the wrnchAI Edge Releases page.

The wrnchAI CHOP will take a few moments to initialize and then will be ready for tracking. Initializing is only required when a new Model Folder is introduced, it will not need to re-initialize each time the project is started.

> **Note:** Wrnch has be acquired by another company and it is no longer possible to obtain a license to use it anymore. This CHOP has been removed in 2022.20000+ builds.

## Parameters

### Setup Page

#### wrnchAI License `license`

Add the Edge License Key from your wrnchAI account here. Requires a separate license from wrnchAI.

#### Model Folder `modelfolder`

Specify the path the the folder that contains the trained models. See Quickstart Guide above for details.

#### GPU Device `gpu`

A menu of available GPU(s) to run wrnchAI on. Selecting 'Default' uses the same GPU TouchDesigner is currently running on.

- **Default** `default` - Uses the same GPU that TouchDesigner is currently assigned to.

#### TOP `top`

Specify the TOP to process for tracking.

#### Body 3D `body3d`

Enable the channels (tx, ty, tz) for body tracking points in 3D space.

#### Body 2D `body2d`

Enable the channels (u, v) for body tracking points in 2D.

#### Body 3D IK `body3dik`

Enable the IK channels (tx, ty, tz, rx, ry, rz and associated roll channels) for body tracking points in 3D space.

#### Face Bounds `facebounds`

Enable the position and bounds channels (u, v, width, height) for faces.

#### Face `face`

Enable the position channels (u, v) for all face tracking points.

#### Hands Bounds `handsbounds`

Enable the position and bounds channels (u, v, width, height) for hands.

#### Hands `hands`

Enable the position channels (u, v) for all hand tracking points.

#### Max Players `maxplayers`

Sets the maximum number of people that can be tracked. For each person/player a new set of channels is created prefixed p1, p2, p3, ... etc.

#### Aspect Correct UVs `aspectcorrectuv`

Adjusts the values of u and v channels to take the TOP's aspect ratio into account. When using non-square input TOP, turn this on to line up u and v position with the image.

### Common Page

#### Time Slice `timeslice`

Turning this on forces the channels to be "Time Sliced". A Time Slice is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.

#### Scope `scope`

To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a Scope string on the Common page.

#### Sample Rate Match `srselect`

Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or "Linear" if the Interpolate Options are not available.

- **Resample At First Input's Rate** `first` - Use rate of first input to resample others.
- **Resample At Maximum Rate** `max` - Resample to the highest sample rate.
- **Resample At Minimum Rate** `min` - Resample to the lowest sample rate.
- **Error If Rates Differ** `err` - Doesn't accept conflicting sample rates.

#### Export Method `exportmethod`

This will determine how to connect the CHOP channel to the parameter. Refer to the Export article for more information.

- **DAT Table by Index** `datindex` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the index of the channel in the CHOP.
- **DAT Table by Name** `datname` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the name of the channel in the CHOP.
- **Channel Name is Path:Parameter** `autoname` - The channel is the full destination of where to export to, such has .

#### Export Root `autoexportroot`

This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by Channel Name is Path:Parameter are relative to.

#### Export Table `exporttable`

The DAT used to hold the export information when using the DAT Table Export Methods (See above).
