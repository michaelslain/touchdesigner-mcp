# TOP to CHOP

**Family:** CHOP (Channel Operator)

## Summary

The TOP to CHOP converts pixels in a TOP image to CHOP channels. Each pixel color element (RGBA) is placed in a separate channel. Depending on the parameter options, the node will either create a single set of channels for the whole image or it can create a separate set of channels for each scanline (row).

A single pixel, rows of pixels, columns of pixels or rectangular regions can be extracted from the image. It is therefore important to be aware of how many pixels your source image is composed of.

The Exclude NaN and Active Mask parameters can be used to skip certain pixels so they are not included in the chop channels.

There is an optional input which supplies UV coordinates to sample the image. The input CHOP must contain 2 channels, for U and V. The first channel is always assumed to be U. The channels produced (red, green, blue and alpha) will be exactly as long as the input channel's length, with a value for each UV coordinate.

If you are grabbing pixels from a Depth TOP, you will only get a single channel (the depth). This will be placed in the R channel.

## Parameters

### Image Page

#### TOP `top`

Specify the TOP operator whose image will be sampled.

#### Download Type `downloadtype`

Gives the option for a delayed data download from the GPU, which is much faster and does not stall the render.

- **Immediate (Slow)** `immediate`
- **Next frame (Fast)** `nextframe`

#### Red `r`

The prefix for channels created from the red pixels of the source image. If multiple red channels are created, they will have a numeric suffix that matches the vertical scanline number of the image e.g. r0 - r4.

#### Green `g`

The prefix for channels created from the green pixels of the source image. If multiple green channels are created, they will have a numeric suffix that matches the scanline number of the image e.g. g0 - g4.

#### Blue `b`

The prefix for channels created from the blue pixels of the source image. If multiple blue channels are created, they will have a numeric suffix that matches the scanline number of the image e.g. b0 - b4.

#### Alpha `a`

The prefix for channels created from the alpha pixels of the source image. If multiple alpha channels are created, they will have a numeric suffix that matches the scanline number of the image e.g. a0 - a4.

#### Output as Single Channel Set `singleset`

Controls whether a channel is created for each scanline, or whether all scanlines are appended into a single channel set. A channel set refers to one CHOP channel per color channel of the source image e.g. 4 channels for an RGBA image.

#### Exclude NaNs `excludenans`

When enabled, pixels that have a NaN value in any of their channels will be skipped and not added to the CHOP channel.

#### Active Channel `activechannel`

When enabled, only pixels that have a non-zero value in the selected active channel will be added to the CHOP channel.

- **None** `none`
- **Red** `red`
- **Green** `green`
- **Blue** `blue`
- **Alpha** `alpha`

#### RGBA Units `rgbaunit`

Scales the output to lie in the range 0-1, 0-255 or 0-65535.

### Common Page

#### Time Slice `timeslice`

Turning this on forces the channels to be "Time Sliced". A Time Slice is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.

#### Scope `scope`

To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a Scope string on the Common page.

#### Sample Rate Match `srselect`

Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or "Linear" if the Interpolate Options are not available.

- **Resample At First Input's Rate** `first` - Use rate of first input to resample others.
- **Resample At Maximum Rate** `max` - Resample to the highest sample rate.
- **Resample At Minimum Rate** `min` - Resample to the lowest sample rate.
- **Error If Rates Differ** `err` - Doesn't accept conflicting sample rates.

#### Export Method `exportmethod`

This will determine how to connect the CHOP channel to the parameter. Refer to the Export article for more information.

- **DAT Table by Index** `datindex` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the index of the channel in the CHOP.
- **DAT Table by Name** `datname` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the name of the channel in the CHOP.
- **Channel Name is Path:Parameter** `autoname` - The channel is the full destination of where to export to, such has .

#### Export Root `autoexportroot`

This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by Channel Name is Path:Parameter are relative to.

#### Export Table `exporttable`

The DAT used to hold the export information when using the DAT Table Export Methods (See above).

#### Parameter Color Space `parmcolorspace`

Controls how all color parameters on this node are interpreted. The color values as treated as being in the selected color space, and are converted to the Working Color Space before they are used as part of the node's operation. Note that this does not change the color space of the node itself, as that is always in the Working Color Space.

- **sRGB** `srgb` - sRGB color space, with sRGB transfer function. Considered an SDR color space with respect to Reference White.
- **sRGB - Linear** `srgblinear` - sRGB color space, with linear transfer function. Considered an SDR color space with respect to Reference White.
- **Rec.601 (NTSC)** `rec601ntsc` - Rec.601 with NTSC primaries color space, with Rec.601 transfer function. Considered an SDR color space with respect to Reference White.
- **Rec.709** `rec709` - Rec.709 color space, with Rec.709 (same as Rec.2020) transfer function. Considered an SDR color space with respect to Reference White.
- **Rec.2020** `rec2020` - Rec.2020 color space, with Rec.2020 (same as Rec.709) transfer function. Considered an HDR color space with respect to Reference White.
- **DCI-P3** `dcip3` - DCI-P3 color space, with D65 white point and 2.6 gamma transfer function. Considered an HDR color space with respect to Reference White.

- **ACES2065-1** `aces2065-1` - ACES 2065-1 (also known as ACES AP0) color space, with a linear gamma transfer function. Considered an HDR color space with respect to Reference White.
- **ACEScg** `acescg` - ACEScg (also known as ACES AP1) color space, with a linear gamma transfer function. Considered an HDR color space with respect to Reference White.
- **Passthrough** `passthrough` - When selected, the color values will be used as-is in the operation, without any modification or attempt to convert them into the Working Color Space.

#### Parameter Reference White `parmreferencewhite`

When converting a parameter color value to the Working Color Space, this controls how it should be treated with respect to Reference White. If the Working Color Space is the same Reference White, then no adjustment is done. If they are different, then the Reference White level (brightness) of this color will be adjusted to the range expected by the Working Color Space. For example if the project is set to have a SDR Reference White of 120 nits, and the HDR Reference White is 80 nits, then a color of (1, 1, 1), which is 120 nits in the SDR color space, will be converted to be (1.5, 1.5, 1.5), which is 120 nits still in the HDR Working Color Space.

- **Default For Color Space** `default` - Will use either the SDR or the HDR Reference White, based on the color space selected.
- **Use Parent Panel** `useparent` - Will use the Reference White that the parent panel has selected. If the top-level panel also has 'Use Parent' selected, then 'UI Reference White' will be used.
- **Standard (SDR)** `sdr` - Will treat the Parameter Color Space as SDR for it's reference white value.
- **High (HDR)** `hdr` - Will treat the Parameter Color Space as HDR for it's reference white value.
- **UI** `ui` - Will treat the Parameter Color Space as UI for it's reference white value. This uses the 'UI Reference White Nits' value for it's brightness.
