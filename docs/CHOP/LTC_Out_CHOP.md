# LTC Out CHOP

**Family:** CHOP (Channel Operator)

## Summary

The LTC Out CHOP outputs "linear timecode" which is a SMPTE timecode data encoded into an audio signal. See also Linear Timecode.

Use an Info CHOP to determine which values are currently being output.

The output of this CHOP can be sent to an Audio Device Out CHOP.

## Parameters

### LTC Page

#### Play Mode `playmode`

Specifies the method used to output LTC, there are 2 options.

- **Sequential** `sequential` - This mode continually plays forward.
- **Timecode Object/CHOP/DAT** `timecodeop` - This mode allows the user to set the LTC value by reference to a timecode in the form of either a CHOP, DAT, or Timecode Class object.

#### Play `play`

Specifies whether the count should increment or hold steady.

#### Cue `cue`

While set to on, the output is held at the specified initial values below.

#### Cue Pulse `cuepulse`

When pulsed, the output is set to the initial values below.

#### Frame `frame`

The initial frame to count from.

#### Second `second`

The initial second to count from.

#### Minute `minute`

The initial minute to count from.

#### Hour `hour`

The initial hour to count from.

#### Frame Rate `framerate`

The number of complete frame messages per second the signal encodes. It is usually between 24 and 30. Note that although we support framerates above 30, using custom usage of the User Bits 1 field, the generated LTC signal is non-standard and will likely not be readable by other software or devices. LTC is limited to 30fps when following the standard.

#### Drop Frame Numbering `dropframe`

Drop frame numbering converts 30 fps time code to the 29.97 fps NTSC standard. Frame numbers 0 and 1 are skipped during the first second of every minute, except multiples of 10 minutes.

#### High FPS Behaviour `highfpsbehaviour`

Specifies the method for counting frame numbers when the set frame rate is higher than the LTC frame rate. Menu enabled only when the set frame rate is a multiple of the LTC frame rate. This menu has 2 options.

- **Cycle Frames** `cycleframes` - This mode loops the LTC frame count until the end of each FPS cycle
- **Duplicate Frames** `duplicateframes` - This mode repeats each individual LTC frame count in multiples until the end of each FPS cycle

#### Timecode Object/CHOP/DAT `timecodeop`

Set the LTC output value with a reference to a timecode. Should be a reference to either a CHOP with channels 'hour', 'second', 'minute', 'frame', a DAT with a timecode string in its first cell, or a Timecode Class object.

#### Audio Rate `audiorate`

This audio sampling rate of the output signal.

### User Page

#### User Data 1 `user1`

Send this value in the bits reserved for User Data 1.

#### User Data 2 `user2`

Send this value in the bits reserved for User Data 2.

#### User Data 3 `user3`

Send this value in the bits reserved for User Data 3.

#### User Data 4 `user4`

Send this value in the bits reserved for User Data 4.

#### User Data 5 `user5`

Send this value in the bits reserved for User Data 5.

#### User Data 6 `user6`

Send this value in the bits reserved for User Data 6.

#### User Data 7 `user7`

Send this value in the bits reserved for User Data 7.

#### User Data 8 `user8`

Send this value in the bits reserved for User Data 8.

### Common Page

#### Time Slice `timeslice`

Turning this on forces the channels to be "Time Sliced". A Time Slice is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.

#### Scope `scope`

To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a Scope string on the Common page.

#### Sample Rate Match `srselect`

Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or "Linear" if the Interpolate Options are not available.

- **Resample At First Input's Rate** `first` - Use rate of first input to resample others.
- **Resample At Maximum Rate** `max` - Resample to the highest sample rate.
- **Resample At Minimum Rate** `min` - Resample to the lowest sample rate.
- **Error If Rates Differ** `err` - Doesn't accept conflicting sample rates.

#### Export Method `exportmethod`

This will determine how to connect the CHOP channel to the parameter. Refer to the Export article for more information.

- **DAT Table by Index** `datindex` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the index of the channel in the CHOP.
- **DAT Table by Name** `datname` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the name of the channel in the CHOP.
- **Channel Name is Path:Parameter** `autoname` - The channel is the full destination of where to export to, such has .

#### Export Root `autoexportroot`

This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by Channel Name is Path:Parameter are relative to.

#### Export Table `exporttable`

The DAT used to hold the export information when using the DAT Table Export Methods (See above).
