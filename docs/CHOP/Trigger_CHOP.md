# Trigger CHOP

**Family:** CHOP (Channel Operator)

## Summary

The Trigger CHOP starts an audio-style attack/decay/sustain/release (ADSR) envelope to all trigger pulses in the input channels. A trigger point occurs whenever the first input's channel increases across the trigger threshold value. Most commonly, an ADSR starts when the input goes from 0 to 1.

The envelope consists of six major sections: delay, attack, peak, decay, sustain and release.

From the time the threshold is reached and while the channel's value is above the release threshold, the envelope is in its sustain phase during which it will delay, attack, peak-hold, decay and then maintain its sustain value.

After the inputs drops below the release threshold, the envelope start its release phase and will drop to 0.

The peak and sustain levels can be set independently, but peak value can never be less than sustain.

This CHOP works with both time-sliced inputs or with static input channels.

For jittery inputs, if you don't want it to trigger until its input has been On for some period, see the OP Snippets for the Trigger CHOP, example "trigger after a time threshold", which uses the Count CHOP.

If on, a complete envelope is produced for each trigger point. If off, the envelope may be terminated at any time by a release point.

#### Remainder `remainder`

See Remainder Options. What to do with remaining samples at end of the interval:

- **Discard Remainder** `crop` - Output interval = input interval.
- **Make Output Longer** `extend` - Output longer if envelope unfinished.
- **Mix Remainder with Beginning** `mix` - Add remainder to samples at the start.

#### Trigger `trigger`

Instantly trigger an envelope (regardless of input).

#### Release `release`

Instantly release an envelope (regardless of input).

#### Reset `reset`

When On, resets the envelope, and matches the output to the input.

#### Reset Pulse `resetpulse`

Instantly resets the envelope.

#### Sustain Level `sustain`

The sustain level. This level is held until a release point is reached (the input goes below the threshold).

#### Min Sustain Length `minsustain`

Set a minimum amount of time for sustain. When set to 0, sustain is simply held for as long as the input is held, but when setting a minimum time here the evelope will always include a sustain for the specified time.

### Chan Page

#### Channel Name `channame`

Name of channels output.

#### Specify Rate `specifyrate`

Allows you to specify the sample rate in the Sample Rate parameter below.

#### Enable Remap Length `enableremaplength`

Enables remapping of the total envelope to a specific length. Note that ‘held sustain’ length is not remapped, only Delay, Attack, Peak, and Release lengths are remapped.

#### Remap Length `remaplength`

Sets the total envelope remapped length.

- **Remap Length** `remaplength`
- **Remap Length Unit** `remaplengthunit`

#### Sample Rate `rate`

Sets the sample rate of the output. Only used when Specify Rate is turned on.

### Common Page

#### Time Slice `timeslice`

Turning this on forces the channels to be "Time Sliced". A Time Slice is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.

#### Scope `scope`

To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a Scope string on the Common page. See Pattern Matching.

#### Sample Rate Match `srselect`

Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or "Linear" if the Interpolate Options are not available.

- **Resample At First Input's Rate** `first` - Use rate of first input to resample others.
- **Resample At Maximum Rate** `max` - Resample to the highest sample rate.
- **Resample At Minimum Rate** `min` - Resample to the lowest sample rate.
- **Error If Rates Differ** `err` - Doesn't accept conflicting sample rates.

#### Export Method `exportmethod`

This will determine how to connect the CHOP channel to the parameter. Refer to the Export article for more information.

- **DAT Table by Index** `datindex` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the index of the channel in the CHOP.
- **DAT Table by Name** `datname` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the name of the channel in the CHOP.
- **Channel Name is Path:Parameter** `autoname` - The channel is the full destination of where to export to, such has .

#### Export Root `autoexportroot`

This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by Channel Name is Path:Parameter are relative to.

#### Export Table `exporttable`

The DAT used to hold the export information when using the DAT Table Export Methods (See above).

#### Rename from `commonrenamefrom`

The channel pattern to rename. See Pattern Matching.

#### Rename to `commonrenameto`

The replacement pattern for the names. The default parameters do not rename the channels. See Pattern Replacement. Example: Channel Names: c[1-10:2] ambient Rename From: c* ambient Rename To: b[1-5] ambThis example fetches channels c1 c3 c5 c7 c9 and ambient. They are then renamed to to b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 and amb.
