# Ableton Link CHOP

**Family:** CHOP (Channel Operator)

## Summary

The Ableton Link CHOP retrieves timing information from an Ableton Link supported network. For more information see: http://www.ableton.com/en/link/

The full support of the Ableton Live system is TDAbleton, a group of components that give you access to Ableton Songs, Tracks, Chains, Parameters and MIDI.

Ableton's Link FAQ is very helpful for issues on the Ableton end: https://help.ableton.com/hc/en-us/articles/209776125-Link-FAQs.

One common problem is that Ableton Link doesn't work with all sound drivers, including DirectX. The free application ASIO4All is an easy replacement that acts as a virtual ASIO device.

## Parameters

### Ableton Page

#### Active `active`

Turns the CHOP's output on or off.

#### Enable `enable`

Initializes the connection to the Ableton Link session.

#### Start Stop Sync Enable `startstopsync`

Enables start stop synchronization for the entire Ableton Link session. Start stop synchronization allows for sharing of start or stop signals between subgroups of peers in a Link session.

#### Signature `signature`

Specifies the time signature. The first number is the number of beats per measure and the second number indicates the type of note that constitutes one beat. See Time Signature - Wikipedia for additional information.

- **signature1** `signature1`
- **signature2** `signature2`

#### Callbacks DAT `callbacks`

Path to a DAT containing callbacks for each event received.

### Output Page

#### Status Channels `status`

Enables the following status channels numpeers - number of Ableton Link enabled devices or app found on the network. linked - if the Ableton Link CHOP is connected to the Link network. waiting - if the Ableton Link CHOP is in a waiting state and not synced. synced - if the Ableton Link CHOP has synced with the Link network.

#### Ramp `ramp`

Outputs a 0-1 ramp each bar.

#### Pulse `pulse`

Outputs a pulse each bar.

#### Sine `sine`

Outputs a sine wave each bar.

#### Count `count`

Increases the count each bar.

#### Count+Ramp `countramp`

A ramp that counts up until the bar is reset.

#### Bar `bar`

Output the current bar.

#### Beat `beat`

Output the current beat.

#### Sixteenths `sixteenths`

Output the current sixteenths.

#### Ramp Bar `rampbar`

Outputs a 0-1 ramp each bar.

#### Ramp Beat `rampbeat`

Outputs a 0-1 ramp each beat.

#### Tempo `tempo`

Outputs the current tempo (also known as BPM).

#### Beats `beats`

Outputs the total number of beats.

#### Phase `phase`

Outputs the current phase in the bar.

### Common Page

#### Time Slice `timeslice`

Turning this on forces the channels to be "Time Sliced". A Time Slice is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.

#### Scope `scope`

To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a Scope string on the Common page. See Pattern Matching.

#### Sample Rate Match `srselect`

Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or "Linear" if the Interpolate Options are not available.

- **Resample At First Input's Rate** `first` - Use rate of first input to resample others.
- **Resample At Maximum Rate** `max` - Resample to the highest sample rate.
- **Resample At Minimum Rate** `min` - Resample to the lowest sample rate.
- **Error If Rates Differ** `err` - Doesn't accept conflicting sample rates.

#### Export Method `exportmethod`

This will determine how to connect the CHOP channel to the parameter. Refer to the Export article for more information.

- **DAT Table by Index** `datindex` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the index of the channel in the CHOP.
- **DAT Table by Name** `datname` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the name of the channel in the CHOP.
- **Channel Name is Path:Parameter** `autoname` - The channel is the full destination of where to export to, such has .

#### Export Root `autoexportroot`

This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by Channel Name is Path:Parameter are relative to.

#### Export Table `exporttable`

The DAT used to hold the export information when using the DAT Table Export Methods (See above).

#### Rename from `commonrenamefrom`

The channel pattern to rename. See Pattern Matching.

#### Rename to `commonrenameto`

The replacement pattern for the names. The default parameters do not rename the channels. See Pattern Replacement. Example: Channel Names: c[1-10:2] ambient Rename From: c* ambient Rename To: b[1-5] ambThis example fetches channels c1 c3 c5 c7 c9 and ambient. They are then renamed to to b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 and amb.
