# Touch Out CHOP

**Family:** CHOP (Channel Operator)

## Summary

The Touch Out CHOP can be used to create high speed connection between two TouchDesigner processes. Data is sent over TCP/IP. The Touch Out CHOP (server) sends it's data to a Touch In CHOP (client). The Touch Out CHOP is similar to a Pipe Out CHOP but highly optimized for TouchDesigner-to-TouchDesigner communication. For interfacing with other software or devices, see the Pipe Out CHOP.

To receive network data from another "server" computer (e.g. from a TouchDesigner Touch Out CHOP running remotely), a connection must be established between the server and the Touch In CHOP before data is sent. You must supply the Server Address and Port from which to receive incoming data to a channel. The server should be listening for connections on the port that this CHOP is using. Multiple Touch In CHOPs (clients) can receive data from a single Touch Out CHOP (server).

NOTE for Windows OS - If experiencing connection issues make sure Windows Firewall is disabled.

## Parameters

### Touch Out Page

#### Protocol `protocol`

Selects which network protocol to use to transfer data. Different protocol's have methods of connecting and using the address parameter. For more information refer to the Network Protocols article.

- **Streaming (TCP/IP)** `streaming`
- **Messaging (UDP)** `msging`
- **Multi-Cast Messaging (UDP)** `multicastmsging`

#### Address `address`

The address to use, not all protocls require an address to be specified on the sending side.

#### Network Port `port`

The network port to use.

#### Active `active`

When Off, data is not sent.

#### Max Queue Size `maxsize`

Limits the number of events waiting to be sent. This prevents overflows if the connection is too slow.

#### Max Queue Size Unit `maxsizeunit`

Choose between using Samples, Frames, or Seconds as the units for the Max Queue Size parameter.

#### Cook Every Frame `cookalways`

Specifies that this CHOP should be cooked every frame regardless of CHOPs below it are cooking.

#### Resend Names `resendnames`

Resends all the channel names. Generally you don't need to use this parameter, but it is provided just in-case.

#### Use Synced Ports `syncports`

This parameter lets you send the the data in a single global pipe if required. This can be important if various data streams must be sent in frame sync. For more information, refer to Touch In/Out Synced Ports.

- **Off** `off` - Uses separate ports for each port number assigned.
- **On** `on` - Uses a single global pipe for all Touch Out CHOPs using this Transfer Port Type. The global pipe uses port 10500 internally to send all the global port type data together at once. The Network Port parameter is still used to determine which Touch In CHOP gets the data on the receiving side. Note that since a single port is used (10500), only one process on a machine can be serving Synced Port data.

### Common Page

#### Time Slice `timeslice`

Turning this on forces the channels to be "Time Sliced". A Time Slice is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.

#### Scope `scope`

To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a Scope string on the Common page. See Pattern Matching.

#### Sample Rate Match `srselect`

Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or "Linear" if the Interpolate Options are not available.

- **Resample At First Input's Rate** `first` - Use rate of first input to resample others.
- **Resample At Maximum Rate** `max` - Resample to the highest sample rate.
- **Resample At Minimum Rate** `min` - Resample to the lowest sample rate.
- **Error If Rates Differ** `err` - Doesn't accept conflicting sample rates.

#### Export Method `exportmethod`

This will determine how to connect the CHOP channel to the parameter. Refer to the Export article for more information.

- **DAT Table by Index** `datindex` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the index of the channel in the CHOP.
- **DAT Table by Name** `datname` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the name of the channel in the CHOP.
- **Channel Name is Path:Parameter** `autoname` - The channel is the full destination of where to export to, such has .

#### Export Root `autoexportroot`

This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by Channel Name is Path:Parameter are relative to.

#### Export Table `exporttable`

The DAT used to hold the export information when using the DAT Table Export Methods (See above).

#### Rename from `commonrenamefrom`

The channel pattern to rename. See Pattern Matching.

#### Rename to `commonrenameto`

The replacement pattern for the names. The default parameters do not rename the channels. See Pattern Replacement. Example: Channel Names: c[1-10:2] ambient Rename From: c* ambient Rename To: b[1-5] ambThis example fetches channels c1 c3 c5 c7 c9 and ambient. They are then renamed to to b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 and amb.
