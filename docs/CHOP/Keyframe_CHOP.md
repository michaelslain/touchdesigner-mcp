# Keyframe CHOP

**Family:** CHOP (Channel Operator)

## Summary

The Keyframe CHOP uses channel and keys data in an Animation COMP and creates channels of samples at a selectable sample rate (frames per second).

See also: Animation COMP and Animation Editor

The Keyframe CHOP lets you access the keyframed channel data inside an Animation component. The Animation CHOP allows the channels to be played back with the global frame or seconds index. It can be synced to the internal global beat clock, a specified index, or based on a timing or lookup channel sent into the input. It outputs all channels - either as a single sample or an entire start/end range.

To create/edit/delete keyframed channels, create an Animation COMP and open the Animation Editor by right-clicking on the component and selecting Edit Keyframes... from the pop-up menu. Inside the Animation component a Keyframe CHOP will be outputting the channels created in the editor.

Adding an input to the Keyframe CHOP now acts as a lookup index. In addition it outputs a proper Time Slice if its input is a Time Slice.

The lookup cycles through all the input channels, though only 1 is necessary.

## Parameters

### Keyframe Page

#### Animation Component `animation`

The path to the Animation Component holding the channel and key data.

#### Sample Rate `rate`

The sample rate of the channels, in samples per second.

#### Extend Left `left`

The left extend conditions (before range).

- **Hold** `hold`
- **Slope** `slope`
- **Cycle** `cycle`
- **Mirror** `mirror`
- **Default Value** `default`

#### Extend Right `right`

The right extend conditions (after range).

- **Hold** `hold`
- **Slope** `slope`
- **Cycle** `cycle`
- **Mirror** `mirror`
- **Default Value** `default`

#### Default Value `defval`

The default value for extend conditions.

### Common Page

#### Time Slice `timeslice`

Turning this on forces the channels to be "Time Sliced". A Time Slice is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.

#### Scope `scope`

To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a Scope string on the Common page.

#### Sample Rate Match `srselect`

Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or "Linear" if the Interpolate Options are not available.

- **Resample At First Input's Rate** `first` - Use rate of first input to resample others.
- **Resample At Maximum Rate** `max` - Resample to the highest sample rate.
- **Resample At Minimum Rate** `min` - Resample to the lowest sample rate.
- **Error If Rates Differ** `err` - Doesn't accept conflicting sample rates.

#### Export Method `exportmethod`

This will determine how to connect the CHOP channel to the parameter. Refer to the Export article for more information.

- **DAT Table by Index** `datindex` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the index of the channel in the CHOP.
- **DAT Table by Name** `datname` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the name of the channel in the CHOP.
- **Channel Name is Path:Parameter** `autoname` - The channel is the full destination of where to export to, such has .

#### Export Root `autoexportroot`

This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by Channel Name is Path:Parameter are relative to.

#### Export Table `exporttable`

The DAT used to hold the export information when using the DAT Table Export Methods (See above).
