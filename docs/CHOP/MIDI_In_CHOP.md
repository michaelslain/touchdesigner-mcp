# MIDI In CHOP

**Family:** CHOP (Channel Operator)

## Summary

The MIDI In CHOP reads Note events, Controller events, Program Change events, System Exclusive messages and Timing events from both MIDI devices and files. See also MIDI In Map CHOP.

The MIDI In CHOP receives MIDI events from MIDI devices connected to the serial port, reads MIDI events internal to the workstation (i.e. the built-in software synth), and interprets musical scores in MIDI files. Supported MIDI events are:

MIDI events arriving on separate MIDI channels may be recorded on separate CHOP channels. Also, any number of MIDI CHOPs can read from the same or different sources. TouchDesigner can be configured such that MIDI Start, Stop, or Continue events can control the Timeline and Beat Dialog.

The 'Simplified Output' option creates a channel for every type of MIDI event received, so number of channels expands while the devices is being used. No need to specify name, channel and index patterns.

See also the MIDI In DAT, MIDI Event DAT, MIDI In Map CHOP, MIDI Out CHOP.

> **Note:** The values of the MIDI inputs are saved into the TouchDesigner .toe file, and are restored when the file is reloaded. The physical controllers may be in a different position when the .toe is restarted, causing the values to jump when the controllers are moved. This is unavoidable.

> **Note:** If the sample rate is too low, you may miss MIDI events. A note event may set a sample value to 1, and then the next note event less than 1/30 second later can set it to 0 on the same sample in the CHOP channel. So the event will be missed. Make the sample rate higher, like 600, to catch these events, or make sure that your on-off events coming in are a minimum time separation, as can be achieved through Opcode's MAX.

## Parameters

### Source Page

#### Active `active`

Enable or disable the MIDI In CHOP.

#### MIDI Source `source`

Get MIDI input from a device or a file.

- **Device** `device` - The MIDI events come live from a device.
- **File** `file` - The MIDI events come from an existing file.

#### Device Table `device`

Path to the MIDI device Table DAT

#### Device ID `id`

Specify the id of which device to use.

#### MIDI File `file`

If MIDI file is selected as the MIDI source use this field to specify the name of the MIDI file to read. The file can be read in from disk or from the web. Use http:// when specifying a URL.

#### Read Entire MIDI File `entire`

If enabled, the entire MIDI file is read. Otherwise, the Start and End parameters on the Channel page determine the segment of the file to read.

#### Reset Channels `resetchannels`

Deletes all channels when set to On, new channels will not be added until Reset Channels is turned Off.

#### Reset Channels Pulse `resetchannelspulse`

Instantly deletes all channels.

#### Reset Values `resetvalues`

Resets all channel values to 0 when On, channel values will not be updated until Reset Values is turned Off.

#### Reset Channels Pulse `resetchannelspulse`

Instantly resets all channels to 0.

#### Simplified Output `simplified`

When this is on channels are automatically created when MIDI signal is detected from the selected MIDI device.

#### Preserve Pulses `preservepulses`

When on, quick value transitions (pulses) are spaced out over consecutive output samples. Use this option when pulse frequencies approach or exceed the timeline rate, otherwise they risk overlapping each other and being lost.

#### 1 Based Index `onebased`

Make the index 1 based instead of the default 0 based, which means that the indices will belong to the range 1-128 instead of 0-127. The value of this parameter affects the Note and Controller indices.

#### MIDI Channels `channel`

The CHOP may read from any number of MIDI channels, numbered 1-16. Ranges and multiple entries are supported (i.e. "1 4 6", "1-7 12", "1-5:2"). If Channel Prefix is left blank, then the input streams from multiple MIDI channels will be combined into one set of CHOP channels (i.e., a "note 64 on" event on channel 12 followed by a "note 64 off" event on channel 8 appears in the note 64 CHOP channel as a single note).

#### Channel Prefix `prefix`

When recording from multiple MIDI channels, putting a string like "ch" in this parameter causes the MIDI channel to be split into separate CHOP channels per MIDI channel. Otherwise the MIDI channels are all merged into one set of CHOP channels.

#### Controller Format `format`

Some controllers can be paired together to form 14 bit controllers, rather than the normal 7 bit controllers (controller indices 0-31, 98 and 100). Selecting 14 bit Controllers interprets a pair as one 14 bit controller. Otherwise, they are interpreted as separate 7 bit Controllers.

- **7 bit Controllers** `7bit` - Controllers are assumed to be regular 7 bit value messages.
- **14 bit Controllers** `14bit` - Controllers are received as two 7 bit value messages.

### Record Page

#### Record Method `recordtype`

Determine what to record.

- **Single Frame** `single` - This only outputs the current value of notes, controllers, etc. It does not retain prior values. It creates a CHOP at frame 1 always, so the CHOP causes cooking only when MIDI events come in.
- **Current Frame** `current` - Same as "Single Frame", but the CHOP frame is always at the current frame, so the CHOP changes every frame, causing other CHOPs to recook every frame.
- **Current Time Slice** `ind` - The CHOP frame is always at the current Time Slice.
- **Full Length** `timeline` - The entire length of the timeline is recorded.

#### Record `record`

This parameter is used as a button to start and stop recording into the CHOP channels.

### Note Page

#### Note Name `notename`

Put an "n" in here to generate channels for note events. It is the base name of the CHOP channel used to record notes. If blank, notes are ignored. If the Note Output parameter is set to Separate Channels, then CHOP channels will be created for each note in the Note Scope, of the form: notename

#### Note Scope `notescope`

The scope of notes to record. Multiple ranges and notes can be recorded (i.e., "50-60", "64 65 66 70-80").

#### Note Output `notemeth`

Describes how multiple notes are handled. (As one channel, or individual).

- **One Multiplexed Channel** `mult` - One CHOP channel per MIDI channel is used for all notes. The value in the note channel is the number of the note currently playing (in the case of multiple notes playing, the most recent note is selected).
- **Separate Channels** `sep` - Each note number gets its own CHOP channel.

#### Velocity `velocity`

Describes how multiple velocity events are recorded. (Separate channels or combined in one channel as separate samples).

- **Off** `veloff` - Velocity is not recorded.
- **Note Amplitude** `velencode` - The velocity is recorded as the amplitude of the note. Only valid when Note Output is set to Separate Channels.
- **Separate Channels** `velsep` - Velocity is recorded in separate CHOP channels. Each note channel will have a corresponding velocity channel.

#### Velocity Name `velname`

When Velocity is set to Separate Channels, this parameter is the base name of the Velocity CHOP channel (try "v"). If blank, no velocity channels will be recorded.

#### Aftertouch Name `aftername`

The base name of the polyphonic Aftertouch CHOP channels. One aftertouch channel is created for each note in the Note Scope. If blank, no aftertouch channels will be created.

#### Pressure Name `pressname`

The name of the Channel Pressure channel. If multiple channels are being recorded, all channel pressure changes of interest will be recording on this CHOP channel. If blank, this channel will not be created.

#### Normalize `notenorm`

Note values can be normalized for convenience:

- **None** `off` - When Normalize is Off, 7 bit controllers will return values in the range 0-127 and 14 bit controllers will return values in the range 0-16383.
- **0 to 1** `0to1` - These values are normalized to lie in the range 0 to 1.

#### Pitch Wheel Name `pitchname`

The name of the Pitch Wheel CHOP channel. Pitch wheel values range from -1 to +1. If blank, this channel will not be created. Put "p" in here to generate a channel.

### Control Page

#### Controller Name `controlname`

The base name of the Control Change CHOP channels. The channel names are appended with the controller index (0-127). If blank, control changes will not be recorded. It typically contains "c".

#### Controller Type `controltype`

There are 128 different controllers available. By choosing By Index Only, you can specify any number of controllers in the Control Index parameter. Otherwise, you can select a controller from the list from this menu. Some controllers have multiple instances, such as Sound Controllers 1-10. Selecting a controller with multiple instances allows you to use the Control Index parameter to select which instances you want. Any invalid control indices will be ignored.

- **By Index Only** `index` - Specify the controller by its index, as opposed to specifying a specific type below.
- **Bank Select** `n0`
- **Modulation Wheel** `n1`
- **Breath Control** `n2`
- **Foot Controller** `n3`
- **Portamento Time** `n4`
- **Data Entry** `n5`
- **Channel Volume** `n6`
- **Balance** `n7`
- **Pan** `n8`
- **Expression Control** `n9`
- **Effect Control 1-2** `n10`
- **14 bit General Purpose 1-4** `n11`
- **Sustain on/off** `n12`
- **Portamento on/off** `n13`
- **Sustenuto on/off** `n14`
- **Soft Pedal on/off** `n15`
- **Legato Footswitch on/off** `n16`
- **Hold 2 on/off** `n17`
- **Sound Controller 1-10** `n18`
- **7 bit General Purpose 5-8** `n19`
- **Portamento Control** `n20`
- **Effect Depth 1-5** `n21`
- **Non-Registered Parameter** `n22`
- **Registered Parameter** `n23`

#### Controller Index `controlind`

Used to select controllers by number, or multiple controllers by ranges. When in By Index Only Controller Type mode, you can select up to the full 128 controllers or sub-ranges thereof (i.e. "1-10", "2 34 70", "1-32 70-80:2").

#### Normalize `norm`

Controller values can be normalized for convenience:

- **None** `off` - When Normalize is Off, 7 bit controllers will return values in the range 0-127 and 14 bit controllers will return values in the range 0-16383.
- **0 to 1** `0to1` - These values are normalized to lie in the range 0 to 1.
- **-1 to 1** `-1to1` - These values are normalized to lie in the range -1 to +1.
- **On/Off** `onoff` - Several of the controllers are simply on/off states. When Convert to On/Off is enabled, values greater than or equal to 64 will be interpreted as "1" and all values less than 64 will be interpreted as "0".

#### Unwrap `unwrap`

When on, values do not jump between min and max, but are modified to be continuous ramps. Use with knob controllers for examples.

#### Program Change `progname`

Turning this on forces the channels to be "Time Sliced". A Time Slice is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.

#### Scope `scope`

To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a Scope string on the Common page.

#### Sample Rate Match `srselect`
