# Keyboard In CHOP

**Family:** CHOP (Channel Operator)

## Summary

The Keyboard In CHOP receives ASCII input from the keyboard, and outputs channels for the number of keys specified. It creates a single-frame channel representing the current state of each key.

The channels for keys are created by specifying the first key, the number of keys to follow, and the order with which they are selected. Key channel names are either determined by the name of the key, or the channel number.

NOTE: The Keyboard In CHOP does not handle rapid repeats of characters and does not output channels or all keys. A better way is as follows: Create a Panel Execute DAT, and set the 'Panel' parameter to the panel in which keyboard keys need to be monitored. Set the Panel Value to: key. In this DAT, if you enter print(panelValue) in the onValueChange() callback, you will see a line printed for every keystroke.

## Parameters

### Keys Page

#### Active `active`

While On, the keyboard inputs will be monitored and the CHOP will cook every frame. When set to Off it will not cook and the current keyboard values will not be output. While Playing will capture keyboard events only when the Timeline is playing forward.

- **Off** `off`
- **On** `on`
- **While Playing** `play`

#### Keys `keys`

Enter the keys to monitor create a channel for. Can be selected from the dropdown menu on the right. Valid keys are the numbers 0-9, letters A-Z, and keypad 0-9.

#### Modifier Keys `modifiers`

If it is set to Ctrl, the keys will only go On if you are also pressing the Ctrl key. This works similarly for Alt and Shift modifiers. If it set to Ignore, it doesn't matter if the Ctrl/Alt/Shift key is down or not.

- **Ignore** `ignore`
- **None** `none`
- **Control** `ctrl`
- **Alt** `alt`
- **Control and Alt** `ctrlalt`
- **Shift** `shift`
- **Shift and Alt** `shiftalt`
- **Shift and Control** `shiftctrl`
- **Shift and Control and Alt** `shiftctrlalt`

#### Channel Names `channelnames`

Channel names are generated automatically using one of these criteria.

- **by Key Name** `key` - Keys Q W R will be called kq kw ke, based on the key name (key pad channels are named kp0, kp1...).
- **by Channel Number** `number` - Channels are named k1 k2 k3 k4 based on the order of the channels.

#### Panels `panels`

When a path to a Panel COMP(s) is specified, only keyboard events that take place when that panel(s) has focus will reported by the Keyboard In CHOP.

### Channel Page

#### Sample Rate `rate`

The sample rate of the channels, in samples per second.

#### Extend Left `left`

The left extend conditions (before range).

- **Hold** `hold` - Hold the current value of the channel.
- **Slope** `slope` - Continue the slope before the start of the channel.
- **Cycle** `cycle` - Cycle the channel repeatedly.
- **Mirror** `mirror` - Cycle the channel repeatedly, mirroring every other cycle.
- **Default Value** `default` - Use the constant value specified in the Default Value parameter.

#### Extend Right `right`

The right extend conditions (after range).

- **Hold** `hold` - Hold the current value of the channel.
- **Slope** `slope` - Continue the slope after the end of the channel.
- **Cycle** `cycle` - Cycle the channel repeatedly.
- **Mirror** `mirror` - Cycle the channel repeatedly, mirroring every other cycle.
- **Default Value** `default` - Use the constant value specified in the Default Value parameter.

#### Default Value `defval`

The value used for the Default Value extend condition.

### Common Page

#### Time Slice `timeslice`

Turning this on forces the channels to be "Time Sliced". A Time Slice is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.

#### Scope `scope`

To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a Scope string on the Common page.

#### Sample Rate Match `srselect`

Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or "Linear" if the Interpolate Options are not available.

- **Resample At First Input's Rate** `first` - Use rate of first input to resample others.
- **Resample At Maximum Rate** `max` - Resample to the highest sample rate.
- **Resample At Minimum Rate** `min` - Resample to the lowest sample rate.
- **Error If Rates Differ** `err` - Doesn't accept conflicting sample rates.

#### Export Method `exportmethod`

This will determine how to connect the CHOP channel to the parameter. Refer to the Export article for more information.

- **DAT Table by Index** `datindex` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the index of the channel in the CHOP.
- **DAT Table by Name** `datname` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the name of the channel in the CHOP.
- **Channel Name is Path:Parameter** `autoname` - The channel is the full destination of where to export to, such has .

#### Export Root `autoexportroot`

This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by Channel Name is Path:Parameter are relative to.

#### Export Table `exporttable`

The DAT used to hold the export information when using the DAT Table Export Methods (See above).
