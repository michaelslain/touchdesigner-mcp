# Copy CHOP

**Family:** CHOP (Channel Operator)

## Summary

The Copy CHOP produces multiple copies of the second input along the timeline of the first input. The first input provides the trigger signals or the convolve levels.

The Copy CHOP can be used to produce a motion every time a trigger occurs. It can be used to trigger motion, such as eyelid blinks. The copies it produces can be identical, or the copies can be re-cooked each time a copy is added to the timeline. It is useful for triggering a sound multiple times, where the sounds may overlap in time.

Each copy that is added to the output can be completely different than any other copy. By passing variables through the Variables page, the second (Copy) input can be any CHOP chain that uses the variables and recooks to create each copy.

## Parameters

### Copy Page

#### Copy Method `method`

Select which copy method to use from the menu options below.

- **Triggered Copy** `trigger` - The second input is copied at the first input's trigger points only. A trigger point occurs whenever the first input's channel crosses the Trigger Threshold value. Overlapping copies are added.
- **Convolve** `convolve` - For every sample in the first input's channel, the second input is shifted to that point in time, scaled by the sample value, and added into the output channels.

#### Output Method `output`

Select which output method to use from the menu options below.

- **One Channel per Template Channel** `match` - Each output channel is a channel from the first input combined with the corresponding channel from the second input.
- **One Channel per Copy Channel** `accum` - Each output channel is a channel from the second input, with copies triggered by every channel of the first input.

#### Trigger Threshold `threshold`

The threshold value for triggering copies.

#### Remainder `remainder`

See Remainder parameter below..

- **Discard Remainder** `crop`
- **Make Output Longer** `extend`
- **Mix Remainder with Beginning** `mix`

#### Keep Non-Scoped Channels `keep`

If enabled, non-scoped channels are copied to the output, otherwise they are deleted.

### Stamp Page

#### Stamp Inputs `stamp`

Recook the second input for each triggered copy.

#### Copy `copy`

Sequence of values available as stamps. Param copy0param - The parameters are re-calculated for each copy. Set the parameter name here and the value below. You can use CHOP Members and Methods. The parameters you set here are available to any CHOP in the network attached to the second input through the function: fetchStamp(key, default) Value copy0value - Set the parameter's value to be copied.

### Common Page

#### Time Slice `timeslice`

Turning this on forces the channels to be "Time Sliced". A Time Slice is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.

#### Scope `scope`

To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a Scope string on the Common page. See Pattern Matching.

#### Sample Rate Match `srselect`

Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or "Linear" if the Interpolate Options are not available.

- **Resample At First Input's Rate** `first` - Use rate of first input to resample others.
- **Resample At Maximum Rate** `max` - Resample to the highest sample rate.
- **Resample At Minimum Rate** `min` - Resample to the lowest sample rate.
- **Error If Rates Differ** `err` - Doesn't accept conflicting sample rates.

#### Export Method `exportmethod`

This will determine how to connect the CHOP channel to the parameter. Refer to the Export article for more information.

- **DAT Table by Index** `datindex` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the index of the channel in the CHOP.
- **DAT Table by Name** `datname` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the name of the channel in the CHOP.
- **Channel Name is Path:Parameter** `autoname` - The channel is the full destination of where to export to, such has .

#### Export Root `autoexportroot`

This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by Channel Name is Path:Parameter are relative to.

#### Export Table `exporttable`

The DAT used to hold the export information when using the DAT Table Export Methods (See above).

#### Rename from `commonrenamefrom`

The channel pattern to rename. See Pattern Matching.

#### Rename to `commonrenameto`

The replacement pattern for the names. The default parameters do not rename the channels. See Pattern Replacement. Example: Channel Names: c[1-10:2] ambient Rename From: c* ambient Rename To: b[1-5] ambThis example fetches channels c1 c3 c5 c7 c9 and ambient. They are then renamed to to b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 and amb.
