# Kinect Azure CHOP

**Family:** CHOP (Channel Operator)

## Summary

The Kinect Azure CHOP can be used to obtain body tracking information, including joint positions and rotations, and IMU sensor data from a Microsoft Kinect Azure camera or a Kinect compatible Orbbec Camera (Femto Mega, Femto Bolt, etc).

This CHOP requires a Kinect Azure TOP to connect to the camera and to configure the camera's settings. Not all configuration settings support body tracking e.g. Passive IR depth mode. Body tracking can only be used by one hardware type at a time (Microsoft or Orbbec). If more than one hardware type tries to use body tracking in a project, only the first node to be cooked will be enabled.

Use the Max Players parameter to determine how many players you would like the camera to track. The TOP will automatically assign any bodies that are discovered by the device to the available player spaces. Due to the system used to detect player skeletons from the depth camera image, body tracking data can lag multiple frames behind the image data. To more closely synchronize body and image data, use the 'Sync Body Tracking To Image' option on the primary Kinect Azure TOP that is controlling the device (synchronization will increase lag in the image capture).

For a diagram of the joints tracked and their hierarchy, visit Microsoft's Kinect Azure SDK.

Acceleration and rotation data from the camera's IMU sensor can be obtained by enabling the 'IMU Channels' parameter.

## Parameters

### Kinect Azure Page

#### Active `active`

Enable to disable the capturing of body tracking data. The primary Kinect Azure TOP must also be active to receive data.

#### Kinect Azure TOP `top`

The name of the Kinect Azure TOP that is connected to the camera.

#### Max Players `maxplayers`

The number of player skeletons that should be tracked by the device. If the camera does not find enough skeletons, then the extra channels will be set to zero.

#### Relative Bone Rotations `relbonerotations`

Include rotation data for all bone in the skeleton. Rotation is measured in degrees around the XYZ axes relative to the bone's parent.

#### Absolute Bone Rotations `absbonerotations`

Include absolute rotation data for all bone in the skeleton. Rotation is measured in degrees around the XYZ axes relative to the world.

#### Bone Lengths `bonelengths`

Include channels for the length of each bone. A bone's length is the distance between a joint and its parent joint. See the Kinect Azure SDK for a diagram of the joint heirarchy.

#### World Space Positions `worldspace`

Include channels for the bone's absolute world position in meters.

#### Color Image Positions `colorspace`

Include channels for the skeleton positions in UV coordinates of the Color Image.

#### Depth Image Positions `depthspace`

Include channels for the skeleton positions in UV coordinates of the Depth Image.

#### Aspect Correct UVs `aspectcorrectuv`

Scale the image space positions to that they match the aspect ratio of the corresponding camera.

#### Mirror Image V Positions `flipimagev`

Flip the v coordinate of the image space positions so that 0,0 would be in the top-left corner. This was the default behaviour prior to version 2020.44130.

#### Mirror U Positions `flipskelu`

Mirror's the U coordintate of Color Image Positions and Depth Image Positions above which is useful when those images have been flipped in U (x axis flip like a mirror).

#### Bone Confidence `confidence`

The confidence that the sensor has that a joint's position and rotation is correct. It can be one of the following values: 0 - The joint is out of range (too far from the camera) 1 - The joint cannot be seen by the sensor and is predicted based on the neighbouring joints 2 - Medium confidence. The sensor is reasonably confident of the joint's position/rotation. This is currently the highest level of confidence the sensor will produce. 3 - High confidence. Reserved for future use.

#### IMU Channels `imuchans`

Include temperature, acceleration and rotation data from the camera's IMU sensor.

### Common Page

#### Time Slice `timeslice`

Turning this on forces the channels to be "Time Sliced". A Time Slice is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.

#### Scope `scope`

To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a Scope string on the Common page.

#### Sample Rate Match `srselect`

Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or "Linear" if the Interpolate Options are not available.

- **Resample At First Input's Rate** `first` - Use rate of first input to resample others.
- **Resample At Maximum Rate** `max` - Resample to the highest sample rate.
- **Resample At Minimum Rate** `min` - Resample to the lowest sample rate.
- **Error If Rates Differ** `err` - Doesn't accept conflicting sample rates.

#### Export Method `exportmethod`

This will determine how to connect the CHOP channel to the parameter. Refer to the Export article for more information.

- **DAT Table by Index** `datindex` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the index of the channel in the CHOP.
- **DAT Table by Name** `datname` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the name of the channel in the CHOP.
- **Channel Name is Path:Parameter** `autoname` - The channel is the full destination of where to export to, such has .

#### Export Root `autoexportroot`

This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by Channel Name is Path:Parameter are relative to.

#### Export Table `exporttable`

The DAT used to hold the export information when using the DAT Table Export Methods (See above).
