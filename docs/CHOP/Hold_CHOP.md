# Hold CHOP

**Family:** CHOP (Channel Operator)

## Summary

The Hold CHOP waits for a 0 to 1 step on its second input, at which time it reads the current values from the first input (one value per channel). It holds the values constant until it receives another 0 to 1 step. The second input controls the sampling. When the second input changes from 0 to 1, the first input is sampled. This value is held in the output until the second input changes from 0 to 1 again. Hold does not sample while the second input is 1, nor on the falling edge (1 to 0).

A common application for this CHOP is to grab the current value of a channel when an event occurs, so that value can be used until the event occurs again.

## Parameters

### Sample Page

#### Sample `sample`

Defines when to sample the input channels. The parameters are as follows.

- **Off to On** `offtoon` - Sample incoming channel when the trigger channel goes from 0 to above 0.
- **While On** `whileon` - Sample incoming channel while the trigger channel is above 0.
- **On to Off** `ontooff` - Sample incoming channel when the trigger channel goes above 0 to 0.
- **While Off** `whileoff` - Sample incoming channel while the trigger channel is 0.
- **On Value Change** `valuechange` - Sample incoming channel whenever the trigger channel changes.

#### Hold Last `hold`

When On continue to sample the input, when Off hold the values.

#### Hold Last Pulse `holdpulse`

Sample the input and hold those values when pulsed.

#### Hold per Sample `holdsamples`

Useful for working with multi-sample channels, this applies the hold to each sample of the channel instead of only the last sample in the channel.

### Common Page

#### Time Slice `timeslice`

Turning this on forces the channels to be "Time Sliced". A Time Slice is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.

#### Scope `scope`

To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a Scope string on the Common page. See Pattern Matching.

#### Sample Rate Match `srselect`

Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or "Linear" if the Interpolate Options are not available.

- **Resample At First Input's Rate** `first` - Use rate of first input to resample others.
- **Resample At Maximum Rate** `max` - Resample to the highest sample rate.
- **Resample At Minimum Rate** `min` - Resample to the lowest sample rate.
- **Error If Rates Differ** `err` - Doesn't accept conflicting sample rates.

#### Export Method `exportmethod`

This will determine how to connect the CHOP channel to the parameter. Refer to the Export article for more information.

- **DAT Table by Index** `datindex` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the index of the channel in the CHOP.
- **DAT Table by Name** `datname` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the name of the channel in the CHOP.
- **Channel Name is Path:Parameter** `autoname` - The channel is the full destination of where to export to, such has .

#### Export Root `autoexportroot`

This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by Channel Name is Path:Parameter are relative to.

#### Export Table `exporttable`

The DAT used to hold the export information when using the DAT Table Export Methods (See above).

#### Rename from `commonrenamefrom`

The channel pattern to rename. See Pattern Matching.

#### Rename to `commonrenameto`

The replacement pattern for the names. The default parameters do not rename the channels. See Pattern Replacement. Example: Channel Names: c[1-10:2] ambient Rename From: c* ambient Rename To: b[1-5] ambThis example fetches channels c1 c3 c5 c7 c9 and ambient. They are then renamed to to b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 and amb.

## Info CHOP Channels

Extra Information for the Hold CHOP can be accessed via an Info CHOP.

### Common CHOP Info Channels
- start - Start of the CHOP interval in samples.
- length - Number of samples in the CHOP.
- sample_rate - The samplerate of the channels in frames per second.
- num_channels - Number of channels in the CHOP.
- time_slice - 1 if CHOP is Time Slice enabled, 0 otherwise.
- export_sernum - A count of how often the export connections have been updated.

### Common Operator Info Channels
- total_cooks - Number of times the operator has cooked since the process started.
- cook_time - Duration of the last cook in milliseconds.
- cook_frame - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the component timeline.
- cook_abs_frame - Frame number when this operator was last cooked relative to the absolute time.
- cook_start_time - Time in milliseconds at which the operator started cooking in the frame it was cooked.
- cook_end_time - Time in milliseconds at which the operator finished cooking in the frame it was cooked.
- cooked_this_frame - 1 if operator was cooked this frame.
- warnings - Number of warnings in this operator if any.
- errors - Number of errors in this operator if any.
