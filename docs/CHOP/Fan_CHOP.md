# Fan CHOP

**Family:** CHOP (Channel Operator)

## Summary

The Fan CHOP converts one channel out to many channels, or converts many channels down to one.

Its first operation, Fan Out, takes one channel and generates 2 or more channels. It sets to 1 one of the output channels while all others are 0, based on the input channel's value. The first output channel is index value 0, the second, 1, and so on. If the input value is above N-1 or below 0, the value can be clamped, cycled or ignored.

For example, if the value of the input channel at a certain frame is 4, and if the CHOP outputs 8 channels, the fifth channel will have a value of 1, and all other channels will have a zero value at that frame.

The input is assumed to have 1 channel which contains integer values; fractions are truncated and extra channels are ignored. The output channels are binary (0 or 1) channels.

The second operation, Fan In, does the opposite: it takes a bunch of binary inputs and produces one channel containing the index of the "On" channel. If more than one input channel is "On", the first "On" input channel is selected.

## Parameters

### Fan Page

#### Operation `fanop`

Selects either Fan In or Fan Out.

- **Fan Out** `out` - Takes one channel and generates 2 or more channels. It sets to 1 one of the output channels while all others are 0, based on the input channel's value. The first output channel is index value 0, the second, 1, and so on. If the input value is above N-1 or below 0, the value can be clamped, cycled or ignored. The number of channels generated depends on the 'Channel Names' parameter.
- **Fan In** `in` - Takes multiple channels as input and produces one channel containing the index of the "On" channel. If more than one input channel is "On", the first "On" input channel is selected. For example if there are 5 channels (chan1, chan2, chan3, chan4, chan5), and chan3 is 1 while the others are 0, then the output channel value will be equal to 2, since the indexing is 0-based.

#### Channel Names `channame`

The names for the output channels that this CHOP creates. This also controls how many output channels are created (one for each name) in Fan Out mode. In Fan In mode, only one channel is created, and its name is the base name (minus the number suffix) of the first input channel.

#### Outside Range `range`

Determines how to handle input values that are outside the index range (0 to N-1).

- **Clamp Index** `clamp` - If less than 0, clamp to 0, and if greater than N-1, clamp to N-1.
- **Loop Index** `loop` - Loop back through the index list.
- **Set Channels To 0** `zero` - Don't select any channels; set every channel to zero.

#### All Channels Off `alloff`

For a Fan In operation, when all input channels are off, set the output to -1 or 0.

- **Set To 0** `set0` - Selects the first channel.
- **Set To -1** `setneg` - Doesn't select any of the channels.

#### Quantize Output `quantize`

On by default. Channels are quatized to the nearest integer. For example, if the input channel's value is 5.6 and 6 channels are created, channel 5 is 1, while the rest are 0.

### Common Page

#### Time Slice `timeslice`

Turning this on forces the channels to be "Time Sliced". A Time Slice is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.

#### Scope `scope`

To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a Scope string on the Common page. See Pattern Matching.

#### Sample Rate Match `srselect`

Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or "Linear" if the Interpolate Options are not available.

- **Resample At First Input's Rate** `first` - Use rate of first input to resample others.
- **Resample At Maximum Rate** `max` - Resample to the highest sample rate.
- **Resample At Minimum Rate** `min` - Resample to the lowest sample rate.
- **Error If Rates Differ** `err` - Doesn't accept conflicting sample rates.

#### Export Method `exportmethod`

This will determine how to connect the CHOP channel to the parameter. Refer to the Export article for more information.

- **DAT Table by Index** `datindex` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the index of the channel in the CHOP.
- **DAT Table by Name** `datname` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the name of the channel in the CHOP.
- **Channel Name is Path:Parameter** `autoname` - The channel is the full destination of where to export to, such has .

#### Export Root `autoexportroot`

This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by Channel Name is Path:Parameter are relative to.

#### Export Table `exporttable`

The DAT used to hold the export information when using the DAT Table Export Methods (See above).

#### Rename from `commonrenamefrom`

The channel pattern to rename. See Pattern Matching.

#### Rename to `commonrenameto`

The replacement pattern for the names. The default parameters do not rename the channels. See Pattern Replacement. Example: Channel Names: c[1-10:2] ambient Rename From: c* ambient Rename To: b[1-5] ambThis example fetches channels c1 c3 c5 c7 c9 and ambient. They are then renamed to to b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 and amb.
