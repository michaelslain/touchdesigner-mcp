# Timer CHOP

**Family:** CHOP (Channel Operator)

## Summary

The Timer CHOP is an engine for running timed processes. It outputs channels such as timing fractions, counters, pulses and timer states, and it calls python functions (callbacks) when various timing events occur.

Examples using the Timer CHOP include triggering multiple timed cues, running playlists, timelines, state machines, and driving pre-animated animation components in 3D scenes. See Help -> Operator Snippets for numerous examples.

You set a timer to a number of seconds (or unlimited), frames or samples, and trigger it to start via the Start parameter or the second input CHOP. The Timer CHOP outputs in seconds, frames, samples, fraction and on-off states as it’s counting, including a done channel that goes on when it is complete. When it reaches certain states like end-of-cycles or when it’s done, various python callbacks are called allowing you to customize its behavior.

The Timer CHOP gets triggered by events (via pulsing its parameters or driving its two inputs). It takes events in, counts time, changes state. Via its python callback functions, you can send events out to other nodes, set parameters, get/set values in DATs, CHOPs and storage, restart itself, or trigger other nodes. As such, it can operate as a state machine.

It has play/pause, plus a speed control to slow down or speed up the timer.

It can also cycle indefinitely and then can be signaled to end immediately or at the end of the current cycle.

Recommended: the OP Snippets for Timer CHOP. See the channel descriptions in Initialize Start.

Multiple Timer segments - One Timer CHOP can also have multiple timers within it. By attaching a Table DAT you can define one timer (segment) per row. In Serial Timers mode it allows for one time segment followed by another. In Parallel Timers mode, the timers all run in parallel, each with its own begin time and length, and its own set of output channels.

The Timer CHOP can be Locked to Timeline in a deterministic way, or run more freely in Sequential Mode. When run independently from the timeline, you can jump ahead, break out of cycles, pause, goTo() exact position or timecode in the timer, and dynamically adjust the speed.

Attach an Info DAT to the Timer CHOP to see the timecodes, or use the .timecode members. Custom text strings can be placed in the Info DAT for each segment, and custom animated channels can be created.

To make an entire Timer CHOP loop after the last segment, set the On Done menu to Re-Start.

Chaining Timers - The Timer CHOPs can be chained together, so that when one ends, the next can begin. They just need to all be Initialized together, where the ready_pulse channel of one Timer CHOP is exported to the Initialize parameter of the next Timer CHOP. Then they can be run in sequence, where the output of one Timer CHOP’s done_pulse channel is wired to the Start input (or exported to the Start parameter) of the next Timer CHOP. You start the chain of timers by starting the first Timer CHOP. By using some Timer CHOPs to loop awaiting input or response, or by adding logic to decide which CHOP to start next, state machines can be implemented.

The callbacks are called at different moments during the timer progression.

onInitialize() gets called when you pulse the Initialize parameter. Here you can prepare any part of your setup prior to starting. At the end of Initialize the timer goes into a "ready" state.

onStart() gets called on the frame that the Start parameter is pulsed. The timer then goes into a "running" state.

onTimerActive() gets called every frame that the timer is running and there is no Delay or Play is off.

onCycleStart() gets called if the timer is set to cycle via the Cycle parameters.

Before a cycle or segment ends, an onCycleEndAlert() callback based on the Cycle End Alert parameter can be called to allow you to prepare for the next cycle, segment or Timer CHOP.

onSegmentEnter() and onSegmentExit() get called if the timer is being driven by a Segments DAT which acts like several timers in one. The argument segment in these callbacks is actually an object with useful members including any custom columns you have in your segment table: In onSegmentEnter(), put the code print(help(segment))

onDone() gets called when the timer reaches its finished state.

You can initialize at a specific time by using .masterSeconds in onInitialize().

> **Tip:** What happens when you press Start - The timers are at 0 when you Initialize, for example timer_frames = 0. On the frame when you press Start, by default, the running channel goes from 0 to 1, and all the timer_ counter channels step forward by 1 frame.   If you want the timers to hold at 0 until the next frame, set the Run Value parameter to Zero. This is useful when you are cutting from black or other media to a visible first-frame of a movie when running goes to 1.

## Parameters

### Timer Page

#### Active `active`

The Timer cooks: Never / Always / While Running (while in "running" state) / While Playing (while in "running" state and Play is on).

- **Never** `never`
- **Always** `always`
- **While Running** `running`
- **While Playing** `playing`

#### Time Control `timecontrol`

Sequential (timeline-independent) or Locked to Timeline. In Locked to Timeline, non-deterministic features are disabled. External CHOP Channel lets you drive the master time (.masterSeconds etc) using a CHOP channel defined by the parameters on the External page. External Timecode lets you drive the master time using a timecode CHOP/DAT/Object.

- **Lock To Timeline** `lock` - Output is determined by the current frame position.
- **Sequential** `sequential` - Output runs continuously, regardless of current frame position.
- **External CHOP Channel** `chop` - Output is determined by external CHOP channel value.
- **External Timecode** `timecode` - Output is determined by the value of an external timecode.

#### Defer Par Changes `deferpars`

When On, parameter changes like Length, Cycles and others are ignored until the next Intitalize. When Off, paraameter changes affect the timer immediately (possibly giving jumps in state).

#### Initialize `initialize`

(pulse parameter) Initialize is the signal to get the timer ready: sets the frames, samples and fraction counters to zero (delay, timer, cycle, segment), set the output channels in the proper state, done to be off, the onInitialize() callback is run, and when initialize is complete, it indicates it’s ready by turning on the ready channel, awaiting a Start pulse.

#### Start `start`

(pulse) Start is the signal to begin the timers counting. It will count through the delay first, then the timer length. It does an Initialize if it is not already initialized, and then starts counting.

#### Length Type `lengthtype`

Describes how the length is defined.

- **Fixed** `fixed` - Lengths are finite, that is of a specific duration.
- **Infinite** `infinite` - The segments run continuously without end.

#### Length `length`

(float) the time-length of the timer. Set the Units menu to Seconds, Frames or Samples.

- **Length** `length`
- **Length Units** `lengthunits`

#### Delay `delay`

(float) after Start, the delay before the timer begins counting.

- **Delay** `delay`
- **Delay Units** `delayunits`

#### Run Values `runvalues`

On the frame that Start is triggered and the running channel goes from 0 to 1, this determines what the channels timer_frames, timer_samples and timer_fraction will be. If the menu is set to Zero, these channels will be 0 as they are when the timer is initialized. If set to One, on the first frame running is 1, timer_frames and timer_samples will be set to one frame, and timer_fraction will also have stepped forward by a frame.

- **Zero** `zero`
- **One** `one`

#### Play `play`

(onoff) Pauses the timer. It is basically a 0 or 1 multiplier on the Speed.

#### Speed `speed`

(default 1) Slows down or speeds up the timer.

#### Cue `cue`

Freezes playing at the Cue Point.

- **Cue Pulse** `cuepulse`

#### Cue Point `cuepoint`

Time (Seconds, Frames or Fraction) which the cue point is frozen to.

- **Cue Point** `cuepoint`

#### Cycle `cycle`

(default Off) causes the timer to loop back to 0 when it reaches the end of the cycle.

#### Cycle Limit `cyclelimit`

When the Cycle parameter is On, this determines if it will cycle indefinitely or cycle some maximum number of cycles.

#### Maximum Cycles `maxcycles`

When Cycle is on and Cycle Limit is on, this sets the maximum number of cycles.

#### Cycle End Alert `cycleendalert`

The number of seconds, frames or samples before a cycle, segment or done state is reached that the onCycleEndAlert() callback is called. This allows you to prepare for the next cycle, segment or timer.

- **Cycle End Alert** `cycleendalert`
- **Notify Units** `notifyunits`

#### Exit Segment at End of Cycle `exitendcycle`

When pulsed, it will exit the cycle (and segment) at the end of the currently-playing cycle.

#### Go to Done `gotodone`

Will immediately go to the Done state.

#### On Done `ondone`

Determines which action to take when the timer gets to the end, ie "is done" or finished. Note there is also a onDone callback that can be used for customizing behavior.

- **Do Nothing** `donothing` - No action taken.
- **Re-Initialize** `reinit` - Will re-initialize the timer, this is the same as pulsing the Initialize parameter above.
- **Re-Start** `restart` - Will re-initialize and re-start the timer, this is the same as pulsing the Start parameter above.

#### Go to Next Segment `gotonextseg`

(pulse) Jump to Next Segment. Lingo Segment – each segment acts as one timer, with delay time, length, number of cycles to repeat and other conditions. Begin – in Parallel Timers, the number of seconds after a Start (frames or samples) after which each timer starts counting up from zero. Done – The state it goes into when all the timers has finished counting, whether they are in Parallel or Serial, Segments or not. End – Cycle End is the end of each cycle, Segment End is the end of the segment. Cumulative Time – Zero at Start, a count that is affected by speed and rises while timers are active (not during delays). Running Time – Zero at Start, the wall-clock time since Start was called no matter what are the delays, speeds, cycles or premature clicking of Go To Segment End. It stops counting when Done has been reached.
