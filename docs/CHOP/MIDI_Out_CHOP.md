# MIDI Out CHOP

**Family:** CHOP (Channel Operator)

## Summary

The MIDI Out CHOP sends MIDI events to any available MIDI devices when its input channels change. More flexibly, the Python midioutCHOP Class can be used to send any type of MIDI event to a MIDI device via an existing MIDI Out CHOP. In Tscript, the midi command can output MIDI events.

The MIDI devices can be other software programs (such as midisynth) or devices attached to the serial ports. Channels are used to control the sending of the MIDI events. The channels are evaluated over the last time slice (from the last Timeline position to the current).

The MIDI Out CHOP sends MIDI events based on any changes to its input channels. The channels have to be named appropriately, like ch3c14 and ch7n60.

An event is sent every time a channel changes its value during this slice. All timing is preserved, as long as the Timeline is running in realtime (the "Realtime" flag is in the top menu bar).

Naming the CHOP channels: Channels are mapped to events by their name. Events like notes, controllers and velocities must be followed by the note/controller number (n65, c7). If the number is left off a note event, the note number is the value of the channel. Other events, which are sent to the entire channel, do not need a trailing number (pc, pw). The channel prefix can be used to identify the MIDI channel the event should be sent on (i.e. "ch1n45" assigns that TouchDesigner channel to note 45 messages on MIDI channel 1). Channels can always be renamed with a Rename CHOP before entering the MIDI Out CHOP.

The MIDI Out CHOP sends MIDI velocity as well. The values of the channels entering the MIDI Out CHOPs are sent as the velocity of the note. If Normalize is "None", the channel needs to be 0 to 127. If Normalize is "0 to 1", channel values between 0 and 1 are scaled to be MIDI 0 to 127.

The "Cook Every Frame" option cooks the CHOP every frame, even if the CHOP isn't being displayed. All Volume Off and All Volume On flags are new and emit events for Controller 7 of all 16 channels. MIDI output go in a separate thread to allow output that slows TouchDesigner less. It now works in Time Slice mode for note events and controller events. (Not for Program Change or Sysex messages yet) Note channels only trigger anew Note On when the input channel goes from 0 or less to a value greater than zero. Similar for Note Off events.The channel name determines how it is interpreted.

For example,

These features work in Time Slice mode:

## Parameters

### Dest Page

#### Active `active`

Enable or disable the MIDI Out CHOP.

#### MIDI Destination `destination`

Where the MIDI events are sent to. MIDI Mapper is the default destination.

- **Device** `device`
- **File** `file`

#### Device Table `device`

Path to the MIDI device Table DAT.

#### Device ID `id`

Specify the id of which device to use.

#### One Based Index `onebased`

Make the index 1 based instead of the default 0 based.

#### MIDI File `file`

The filename of the output MIDI file.

#### Write MIDI File `writefile`

Writes all the data to a MIDI file.

#### Channel Prefix `prefix`

The prefix string that all input channels must have in order to extract the channel number from their name (i.e. "ch1note44", with a channel prefix of "ch").

#### Cook Every Frame `cookalways`

Forces a cook of the CHOP every frame. It should be On because the MIDI Out CHOP will otherwise only cook if the CHOP leads to a graphics display viewer. You want it to cooks whether you are displaying anything or not.

### Output Page

#### Automatic Note Off `autonoteoff`

A MIDI 'All Note Off' event can be sent upon the start and/or end of the output.

- **None** `none`
- **At Playback Start** `start`
- **At Playback End** `end`
- **At Playback Start and End** `both`

#### All Notes Off `reset`

Sends an All Notes Off message to all MIDI channels.

#### All Volume Off `volumeoff`

Sends an All Notes Off message to all MIDI channels.

#### All Volume On `volumeon`

Sends an All Notes On message to all MIDI channels.

#### Send Start/Stop/Continue Events `startstop`

Sends the appropriate events when the framebar starts or stops.

#### Send MIDI Timecode `sendmtc`

While enabled, the MIDI Out CHOP will send MIDI Timecode (MTC) as a stream of quarter frame messages.

#### Timecode Object/CHOP/DAT `timecodeop`

The MIDI Timecode value to send. Should be a reference to either a CHOP with channels 'hour', 'second', 'minute', 'frame', a DAT with a timecode string in its first cell, or a Timecode Class object.

### Note Page

#### Note Name `notename`

The base name of the note channels. If input channels have a number after the name, it is assumed to be the note number. If not, the channel value is assumed to contain the note number.

#### Aftertouch Name `aftername`

The name of the aftertouch channel.

#### Pressure Name `pressname`

The name of the channel pressure channel.

#### Normalize `notenorm`

Values in the range 0-1 are mapped to MIDI value 0-127.

- **None** `off`
- **0 to 1** `0to1`

#### Pitch Wheel Name `pitchname`

The name of the pitch wheel channel.

### Control Page

#### Controller Name `controlname`

The base name of the controller channels.

#### Controller Format `controlformat`

Sends 7 or 14 bit controller events.

- **7 bit Controllers** `7bit` - Send single 7-bit controller message.
- **14 bit Controllers** `14bit` - Pair two 7-bit controller messages to be interpreted as a single 14-bit message.

#### Normalize `controlnorm`

Maps channel values from different ranges to 0-127.

- **None** `off`
- **0 to 1** `0to1`
- **-1 to 1** `-1to1`
- **On/Off** `onoff`

#### Program Change `progname`

The name of the program change channel.

#### Bar Ramp Name `barname`

Clock ticks frequency is determined by the period of the ramp. The ramp must be 0 to 1. An incoming channel name for a 0 to 1 ramp over each 4-beat bar.

#### Ticks per Bar `barticks`

Default is 96 = 4 beats * 24 ticks per beat.

### Common Page

#### Time Slice `timeslice`

Turning this on forces the channels to be "Time Sliced". A Time Slice is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.

#### Scope `scope`

To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a Scope string on the Common page. See Pattern Matching.

#### Sample Rate Match `srselect`

Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or "Linear" if the Interpolate Options are not available.

- **Resample At First Input's Rate** `first` - Use rate of first input to resample others.
- **Resample At Maximum Rate** `max` - Resample to the highest sample rate.
- **Resample At Minimum Rate** `min` - Resample to the lowest sample rate.
- **Error If Rates Differ** `err` - Doesn't accept conflicting sample rates.

#### Export Method `exportmethod`

This will determine how to connect the CHOP channel to the parameter. Refer to the Export article for more information.

- **DAT Table by Index** `datindex` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the index of the channel in the CHOP.
- **DAT Table by Name** `datname` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the name of the channel in the CHOP.
- **Channel Name is Path:Parameter** `autoname` - The channel is the full destination of where to export to, such has .

#### Export Root `autoexportroot`

This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by Channel Name is Path:Parameter are relative to.

#### Export Table `exporttable`

The DAT used to hold the export information when using the DAT Table Export Methods (See above).

#### Rename from `commonrenamefrom`

The channel pattern to rename. See Pattern Matching.

#### Rename to `commonrenameto`

The replacement pattern for the names. The default parameters do not rename the channels. See Pattern Replacement. Example: Channel Names: c[1-10:2] ambient Rename From: c* ambient Rename To: b[1-5] ambThis example fetches channels c1 c3 c5 c7 c9 and ambient. They are then renamed to to b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 and amb.
