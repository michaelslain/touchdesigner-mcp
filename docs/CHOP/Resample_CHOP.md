# Resample CHOP

**Family:** CHOP (Channel Operator)

## Summary

The Resample CHOP resamples an input's channels to a new sample rate and/or start/end interval. In all cases, the entire input interval is resampled to match the output interval.

Resample does a simple linear interpolation of the Time Slice in Time Slicing mode. Only the sample rate can be changed.

## Parameters

### Resample Page

#### Method `method`

The resample method to apply to the channels:

- **Same Rate, New Interval** `strech` - Stretches or compresses the channels like the Stretch CHOP.
- **New Rate, Same Time Range** `preserve` - Changes the sample rate without changing the time-length of the CHOP.
- **New Rate, Same Index Range** `index` - Changes the sample rate without changing the number of samples in the CHOP.
- **New Rate, New Interval** `newint` - Changes both the sample rate and stretches/compresses the CHOP.

#### Sample Rate `rate`

The new sample rate.

#### Unit Values `relative`

Determines how the Start/End parameters are interpreted.

- **Absolute** `abs` - The value is the new start/end position.
- **Relative to Start/End** `rel` - The value is a shift from the old start/end position.
- **Relative to Current Frame** `cur`

#### Start `start`

The CHOP's new start position.

#### Start Unit `startunit`

#### End `end`

The CHOP's new end position.

#### End Unit `endunit`

#### Quaternion Blend `quatrot`

Uses quaternions to blend between samples.

#### Interpolation `interp`

The interpolation method to use when resampling:

- **No Interpolation** `nointerp` - Use the value of the nearest sample.
- **Linear** `linear` - Use linear interpolation between samples when the output has more samples. Averages all samples near the new sample when the output has fewer samples.
- **Cubic** `cubic` - Cubically interpolates between samples, for smoother curves than Linear. This method is not recommended for channels with sharp changes.
- **Pulse Preserve** `edge` - A linear interpolation that recognizes single sample pulses and preserves their height and one-sample width. A pulse is a non-zero value proceeded and followed by zero-value samples.
- **Repeat Samples** `edge` - This interpolation provides better spaced results when the lengths are integer multiples of original.

#### Constant Area `constarea`

If enabled, keeps the area under the channel constant by scaling the values of the channel.

#### Correct for Cycles `correct`

If enabled, compensates for cyclic channels (such as angles) by always choosing the shortest step between samples, like 360 to 0 for angles.

#### Cycle Length `cyclelen`

The length of the cycle. 360 is typical for angles.

#### Use Last Frame Only `uselastframe`

Trim to the input CHOP's last frame and perform the resample on that

### Common Page

#### Time Slice `timeslice`

Turning this on forces the channels to be "Time Sliced". A Time Slice is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.

#### Scope `scope`

To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a Scope string on the Common page. See Pattern Matching.

#### Sample Rate Match `srselect`

Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or "Linear" if the Interpolate Options are not available.

- **Resample At First Input's Rate** `first` - Use rate of first input to resample others.
- **Resample At Maximum Rate** `max` - Resample to the highest sample rate.
- **Resample At Minimum Rate** `min` - Resample to the lowest sample rate.
- **Error If Rates Differ** `err` - Doesn't accept conflicting sample rates.

#### Export Method `exportmethod`

This will determine how to connect the CHOP channel to the parameter. Refer to the Export article for more information.

- **DAT Table by Index** `datindex` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the index of the channel in the CHOP.
- **DAT Table by Name** `datname` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the name of the channel in the CHOP.
- **Channel Name is Path:Parameter** `autoname` - The channel is the full destination of where to export to, such has .

#### Export Root `autoexportroot`

This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by Channel Name is Path:Parameter are relative to.

#### Export Table `exporttable`

The DAT used to hold the export information when using the DAT Table Export Methods (See above).

#### Rename from `commonrenamefrom`

The channel pattern to rename. See Pattern Matching.

#### Rename to `commonrenameto`

The replacement pattern for the names. The default parameters do not rename the channels. See Pattern Replacement. Example: Channel Names: c[1-10:2] ambient Rename From: c* ambient Rename To: b[1-5] ambThis example fetches channels c1 c3 c5 c7 c9 and ambient. They are then renamed to to b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 and amb.
