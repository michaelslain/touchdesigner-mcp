# Audio Stream Out CHOP

**Family:** CHOP (Channel Operator)

## Summary

The Audio Stream Out CHOP can stream audio out to any rtsp client such as VideoLAN's VLC media player and Apple's Quicktime, or to a WebRTC peer.

To access the stream in one of these players, open a "Network Stream" or "URL" under the File menu.

Below is an example of a URL used to access the stream in a rtsp client.

The URL required is rtsp://<IP address>:<Port>/<Stream Name>

## Parameters

### Audio Stream Out Page

#### Active `active`

Toggle's the rtsp server on or off.

#### Mode `mode`

Select the stream out mode: either RTSP or WebRTC.

- **RTSP** `rtsp`
- **WebRTC** `webrtc`

#### Port `port`

Port number used to transmit the audio stream. This number is needed in the URL supplied to the client receiving the stream. See example in Summary at top.

#### Stream Name `streamname`

Name assigned to the stream. This stream name is needed in the URL supplied to the client receiving the stream. See example in Summary at top.

### WebRTC Page

#### WebRTC `webrtc`

Set the WebRTC DAT (ie. peer) to send the audio stream over. Setting this will automatically populate the WebRTC Connection parameter menu with available connections.

#### WebRTC Connection `webrtcconnection`

Select the WebRTC peer-to-peer connection. Selecting this will automatically population the WebRTC Track parameter menu with available audio output tracks.

#### WebRTC Track `webrtctrack`

Select the audio output track that's a part of the WebRTC peer-to-peer connection. The audio stream will be sent over this track.

### Common Page

#### Time Slice `timeslice`

Turning this on forces the channels to be "Time Sliced". A Time Slice is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.

#### Scope `scope`

To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a Scope string on the Common page. See Pattern Matching.

#### Sample Rate Match `srselect`

Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or "Linear" if the Interpolate Options are not available.

- **Resample At First Input's Rate** `first` - Use rate of first input to resample others.
- **Resample At Maximum Rate** `max` - Resample to the highest sample rate.
- **Resample At Minimum Rate** `min` - Resample to the lowest sample rate.
- **Error If Rates Differ** `err` - Doesn't accept conflicting sample rates.

#### Export Method `exportmethod`

This will determine how to connect the CHOP channel to the parameter. Refer to the Export article for more information.

- **DAT Table by Index** `datindex` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the index of the channel in the CHOP.
- **DAT Table by Name** `datname` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the name of the channel in the CHOP.
- **Channel Name is Path:Parameter** `autoname` - The channel is the full destination of where to export to, such has .

#### Export Root `autoexportroot`

This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by Channel Name is Path:Parameter are relative to.

#### Export Table `exporttable`

The DAT used to hold the export information when using the DAT Table Export Methods (See above).

#### Rename from `commonrenamefrom`

The channel pattern to rename. See Pattern Matching.

#### Rename to `commonrenameto`

The replacement pattern for the names. The default parameters do not rename the channels. See Pattern Replacement. Example: Channel Names: c[1-10:2] ambient Rename From: c* ambient Rename To: b[1-5] ambThis example fetches channels c1 c3 c5 c7 c9 and ambient. They are then renamed to to b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 and amb.
