# Helios DAC CHOP

**Family:** CHOP (Channel Operator)

## Summary

DEPRECATED: use the Laser Device CHOP instead.

Helios DAC is a laser controller. The Helios DAC CHOP takes as input up to five channels interpreted as X and Y (horizontal and vertical) position values in the first 2 channels, and red, green and blue color values in the next 3 channels. It outputs the data to a Helios DAC. The Helios DAC device is connected to a laser using an ILDA cable. The user can then control the image that the laser should output using the Helios DAC CHOP. Applications of the Helios DAC CHOP include displaying computer-generated shape animations or other special effects of a light show.

Blanking (all-off) occurs when the incoming RGB CHOP channels are all zero, or the Red Scale, Green Scale, and Blue Scale parameters are all zero.

Large changes in RGB values from sample-to-sample will likely be visibly correct as lasers generally can switch on-off quickly.

The range of X and Y is typically -1 to +1, and the range of RGB is typically 0 to 1.

> **Note:** The Helios DAC CHOP listens for any device changes on the system and will perform a Helios device re-scan when triggered. However, the re-scan can only be triggered if all Helios connections are closed, meaning all Helios DAC CHOPs are either deactivated or bypassed. To perform a Helios device re-scan with only a single Helios DAC CHOP, simply deactivate and reactivate the CHOP.

## Parameters

### Helios DAC Page

#### Active `active`

If turned off, the Helios DAC CHOP will stop sending data to the Helios DAC and will immediately clear its point buffer. Consider it equivalent to powering off the Helios DAC.

#### Device `device`

Select the Helios DAC you want to control from this menu.

#### Queue Time (Seconds) `queuetime`

Determines the queue size of the Helios DAC CHOP point buffer and the corresponding time required to drain it. It is often useful to reduce this value when sending fewer points.

#### X Scale `xscale`

Allows the input x values to be scaled by the specified factor.

#### Y Scale `yscale`

Allows the input y values to be scaled by the specified factor.

#### Red Scale `redscale`

Allows the input r values to be scaled by the specified factor.

#### Green Scale `greenscale`

Allows the input g values to be scaled by the specified factor.

#### Blue Scale `bluescale`

Allows the input b values to be scaled by the specified factor.

#### Intensity Scale `intensityscale`

Allows the input intensity values (i) to be scaled by the specified factor.

### Common Page

#### Time Slice `timeslice`

Turning this on forces the channels to be "Time Sliced". A Time Slice is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.

#### Scope `scope`

To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a Scope string on the Common page. See Pattern Matching.

#### Sample Rate Match `srselect`

Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or "Linear" if the Interpolate Options are not available.

- **Resample At First Input's Rate** `first` - Use rate of first input to resample others.
- **Resample At Maximum Rate** `max` - Resample to the highest sample rate.
- **Resample At Minimum Rate** `min` - Resample to the lowest sample rate.
- **Error If Rates Differ** `err` - Doesn't accept conflicting sample rates.

#### Export Method `exportmethod`

This will determine how to connect the CHOP channel to the parameter. Refer to the Export article for more information.

- **DAT Table by Index** `datindex` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the index of the channel in the CHOP.
- **DAT Table by Name** `datname` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the name of the channel in the CHOP.
- **Channel Name is Path:Parameter** `autoname` - The channel is the full destination of where to export to, such has .

#### Export Root `autoexportroot`

This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by Channel Name is Path:Parameter are relative to.

#### Export Table `exporttable`

The DAT used to hold the export information when using the DAT Table Export Methods (See above).

#### Rename from `commonrenamefrom`

The channel pattern to rename. See Pattern Matching.

#### Rename to `commonrenameto`

The replacement pattern for the names. The default parameters do not rename the channels. See Pattern Replacement. Example: Channel Names: c[1-10:2] ambient Rename From: c* ambient Rename To: b[1-5] ambThis example fetches channels c1 c3 c5 c7 c9 and ambient. They are then renamed to to b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 and amb.
