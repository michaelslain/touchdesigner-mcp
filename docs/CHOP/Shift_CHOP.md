# Shift CHOP

**Family:** CHOP (Channel Operator)

## Summary

The Shift CHOP time-shifts a CHOP, changing the start and end of the CHOP's interval. However, the contents of the channels remain the same.

Each channel can be shifted a different amount by using the $C variable in the Scroll parameter or the Start/End parameters.

An optional second input, the Start/End Reference, is used to align the first input CHOP relative to another reference CHOP. This outputs the channels of the first CHOP only, and the shifts are based on the interval of the second CHOP. It is useful for making several CHOPs match up to the same time.

## Parameters

### Shift Page

#### Reference `reference`

The start or the end of the channels can be used as the reference position. The channels are shifted by altering the reference position.

- **Start Position** `refstart` - Uses the start of the CHOP to do the aligning.
- **End Position** `refend` - Uses the end of the CHOP to do the aligning.

#### Unit Values `relative`

Determines how the Start and End parameters are to be interpreted:

- **Absolute** `abs` - The Start/End parameters are the actual start/end position. It is used, for example, to shift the CHOP to start at 0 seconds.
- **Relative to Start/End** `rel` - The Start/End parameters are a shift relative to the input CHOP's start/end position.
- **Relative to Current Frame** `cur` - Ignore the Start/End parameters and use the current frame as the new start position.

#### Start `start`

The start of the interval, absolute or relative to the input CHOP.

#### Start Unit `startunit`

#### End `end`

The end of the interval, absolute or relative to the input CHOP.

#### End Unit `endunit`

#### Scroll Offset `scroll`

Without changing the length of the CHOP, you can scroll the channels within its range, and scroll each channel a different amount. By using $C in the parameter, you can make the scroll amount dependent on the channel index.

#### Scroll Offset Unit `scrollunit`

### Common Page

#### Time Slice `timeslice`

Turning this on forces the channels to be "Time Sliced". A Time Slice is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.

#### Scope `scope`

To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a Scope string on the Common page. See Pattern Matching.

#### Sample Rate Match `srselect`

Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or "Linear" if the Interpolate Options are not available.

- **Resample At First Input's Rate** `first` - Use rate of first input to resample others.
- **Resample At Maximum Rate** `max` - Resample to the highest sample rate.
- **Resample At Minimum Rate** `min` - Resample to the lowest sample rate.
- **Error If Rates Differ** `err` - Doesn't accept conflicting sample rates.

#### Export Method `exportmethod`

This will determine how to connect the CHOP channel to the parameter. Refer to the Export article for more information.

- **DAT Table by Index** `datindex` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the index of the channel in the CHOP.
- **DAT Table by Name** `datname` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the name of the channel in the CHOP.
- **Channel Name is Path:Parameter** `autoname` - The channel is the full destination of where to export to, such has .

#### Export Root `autoexportroot`

This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by Channel Name is Path:Parameter are relative to.

#### Export Table `exporttable`

The DAT used to hold the export information when using the DAT Table Export Methods (See above).

#### Rename from `commonrenamefrom`

The channel pattern to rename. See Pattern Matching.

#### Rename to `commonrenameto`

The replacement pattern for the names. The default parameters do not rename the channels. See Pattern Replacement. Example: Channel Names: c[1-10:2] ambient Rename From: c* ambient Rename To: b[1-5] ambThis example fetches channels c1 c3 c5 c7 c9 and ambient. They are then renamed to to b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 and amb.
