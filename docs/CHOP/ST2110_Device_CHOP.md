# ST2110 Device CHOP

**Family:** CHOP (Channel Operator)

## Summary

This node is used to configure the IP settings of a ST2110 Device such as the DHCP settings, IP configuration and PTP settings. Currently this node does not have any channels it outputs, but it does have some Info CHOP channels that give diagnostic information.

## Parameters

### ST2110 Device Page

#### Active `active`

Controls if this node is actively configuring this device's settings.

#### Driver `driver`

Select which device driver to use to search and communicate with devices.

- **Blackmagic** `blackmagic` - Use the Blackmagic driver.
- **Deltacast** `deltacast` - Use the Deltacast driver.

#### Device `device`

Select the device to configure.

#### Use DHCP `usedhcp`

Chooses if the IP address of the primary port on the device should be configured using DHCP.

#### IP Address `ipaddress`

Manually set the IP address, if DHCP is disabled.

#### Subnet `subnet`

Manually set the subnet, if DHCP is disabled.

#### Gateway `gateway`

Manually set the gateway, if DHCP is disabled.

#### PTP Profile `ptpprofile`

Select the PTP profile to use, for devices that support selection.

- **Off** `off`
- **ST2059-2** `st2059-2`
- **AES67** `aes67`

#### PTP Address `ptpaddress`

Manually set the address of the PTP grandmaster.

#### PTP Domain `ptpdomain`

Manually set the PTP domain.

#### IGMP Version `igmpversion`

Select the IGMP version(s) to use for multicast join/leave and other IGMP operations.

- **Version 2** `vesion2`
- **Version 3** `version3`
- **Version 2 and 3** `version2and3`

### SPS Page

#### Enable SPS `enablesps`

Enables the SPS port on the device.

#### Use DHCP `spsusedhcp`

Chooses if the IP address of the SPS port on the device should be configured using DHCP.

#### SPS IP Address `spsipaddress`

Manually set the IP address, if DHCP is disabled.

#### SPS Subnet `spssubnet`

Manually set the subnet, if DHCP is disabled.

#### SPS Gateway `spsgateway`

Manually set the gateway, if DHCP is disabled.

### Common Page

#### Time Slice `timeslice`

Turning this on forces the channels to be "Time Sliced". A Time Slice is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.

#### Scope `scope`

To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a Scope string on the Common page.

#### Sample Rate Match `srselect`

Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or "Linear" if the Interpolate Options are not available.

- **Resample At First Input's Rate** `first` - Use rate of first input to resample others.
- **Resample At Maximum Rate** `max` - Resample to the highest sample rate.
- **Resample At Minimum Rate** `min` - Resample to the lowest sample rate.
- **Error If Rates Differ** `err` - Doesn't accept conflicting sample rates.

#### Export Method `exportmethod`

This will determine how to connect the CHOP channel to the parameter. Refer to the Export article for more information.

- **DAT Table by Index** `datindex` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the index of the channel in the CHOP.
- **DAT Table by Name** `datname` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the name of the channel in the CHOP.
- **Channel Name is Path:Parameter** `autoname` - The channel is the full destination of where to export to, such has .

#### Export Root `autoexportroot`

This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by Channel Name is Path:Parameter are relative to.

#### Export Table `exporttable`

The DAT used to hold the export information when using the DAT Table Export Methods (See above).

## Info CHOP Channels

Extra Information for the ST2110 Device CHOP can be accessed via an Info CHOP.

### Specific ST2110 Device CHOP Info Channels
- packets_received - The number of packets received on the primary port, or -1 if this query isn't supported by the device.
