# Function CHOP

**Family:** CHOP (Channel Operator)

## Summary

The Function CHOP provides more complicated math functions than found in the Math CHOP : trigonometic functions, logarithmic functions and exponential functions, and also audio decibels (dB)-power-amplitude conversions.

Most of the functions require only one parameter, and they are applied as a unary operator to each input channel. Some functions take two parameters, and these require the use of the second input. The first parameter, X, is always a value from a channel in the first input. The second parameter, Y, is a value from a corresponding channel in the second input. Channels from each input are paired by name or index.

Since many of these functions can produce math errors, an error handling tab is provided for error handling and recovery. Errors can be handled by replacing the bad sample with a pre-defined value or by using the value of the previous sample. Alternatively, cooking can be aborted upon error for debugging networks.

Function types in decibels: as you would employ for audio or other signal strengths. -10dB means 1/10 the power, -20dB means 1/100 the power. It turns out that each 3dB means almost exactly double the power, so +12dB is 2*2*2*2 = 16 times the power. Power is proportional to the square of the amplitude. So -20dB means 1/10 the amplitude, and 6dB is double the amplitude.

## Parameters

#### Match by `match`

How to pair channels together from the two inputs for the binary functions, by name or by channel index.

- **Channel Number** `index`

### Error Page

#### Error Handling `error`

How to correct samples with math errors:

- **Abort With Error Message** `abort` - Cooking aborts.
- **Replace With Specified Values** `replace` - Values specified below.
- **Use The Previous Value** `useprev` - Uses the last good result.

#### + Infinity Value `pinfval`

Value to use when an infinity error occurs. Caused by sinh(), cosh() and tan().

#### - Infinity Value `ninfval`

Value to use when a negative infinity error occurs. Caused by sinh() and tan().

#### Domain Error Value `domval`

Value to use when a domain error occurs. Caused by asin(), acos(), log10(), logN(), ln() and sqrt().

#### Divide Error Value `divval`

Value to use when a divide by zero error occurs. Caused by pow(x,y).

### Common Page

#### Time Slice `timeslice`

Turning this on forces the channels to be "Time Sliced". A Time Slice is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.

#### Scope `scope`

To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a Scope string on the Common page. See Pattern Matching.

#### Sample Rate Match `srselect`

Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or "Linear" if the Interpolate Options are not available.

- **Resample At First Input's Rate** `first` - Use rate of first input to resample others.
- **Resample At Maximum Rate** `max` - Resample to the highest sample rate.
- **Resample At Minimum Rate** `min` - Resample to the lowest sample rate.
- **Error If Rates Differ** `err` - Doesn't accept conflicting sample rates.

#### Export Method `exportmethod`

This will determine how to connect the CHOP channel to the parameter. Refer to the Export article for more information.

- **DAT Table by Index** `datindex` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the index of the channel in the CHOP.
- **DAT Table by Name** `datname` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the name of the channel in the CHOP.
- **Channel Name is Path:Parameter** `autoname` - The channel is the full destination of where to export to, such has .

#### Export Root `autoexportroot`

This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by Channel Name is Path:Parameter are relative to.

#### Export Table `exporttable`

The DAT used to hold the export information when using the DAT Table Export Methods (See above).

#### Rename from `commonrenamefrom`

The channel pattern to rename. See Pattern Matching.

#### Rename to `commonrenameto`

The replacement pattern for the names. The default parameters do not rename the channels. See Pattern Replacement. Example: Channel Names: c[1-10:2] ambient Rename From: c* ambient Rename To: b[1-5] ambThis example fetches channels c1 c3 c5 c7 c9 and ambient. They are then renamed to to b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 and amb.
