# Select CHOP

**Family:** CHOP (Channel Operator)

## Summary

The Select CHOP selects and renames channels from other CHOPs of any CHOP network. You can select the channels from control panel gadgets like sliders and buttons. It retrieves channels from one or more CHOPs.

It selects only the channels you specify. Example: "c2 c5 c3 c3" will result in 4 channels, the last two identical, all in the specified order.

There are two ways of getting channels - through the CHOP and Channel Name parameters or directly from a CHOP connected to its input. All extract and renaming options apply when using the CHOP and Channel Name parameters instead of the wired input.

See Pattern Matching for selecting CHOPs and channels.

It can also rename channels by generating new channel names. See Pattern Replacement and Pattern Expansion for patterns you can use.

See Channel Naming Patterns for more ways to manipulate existing channel names into new ones.

(The Select CHOP gets channels from any CHOP, the Parameter CHOP gets parameters of any OP.)

See also the Rename CHOP (Select CHOP does most of the same things and more.)

## Parameters

### Select Page

#### CHOP `chop`

The source(s) of the channels. (Assuming the CHOP is not directly connected).

#### Channel Names `channames`

The names of the channels to keep. Name patterns may be used. Ex: chan[1-5] *x /project1/geo1:t[xyz]

#### Rename from `renamefrom`

The channel pattern to rename. See Pattern Matching.

#### Rename to `renameto`

The replacement pattern for the names. The default parameters do not rename the channels. See Pattern Replacement. Example: Channel Names: c[1-10:2] ambient Rename From: c* ambient Rename To: b[1-5] ambThis example fetches channels c1 c3 c5 c7 c9 and ambient. They are then renamed to to b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 and amb.

#### Filter by Digits `filterbydigits`

This toggle enables the two parameters below to select channels with the specified digits at the end of their name. For examples, this can be used to selct all channels with a name ending in the digit "1", such as tx1, ty1, tz1, rotate1, etc.

#### Digits `digits`

Specify the digit at then end of the channel names you want to select when using 'Filter by Digits'

#### Strip Digits `stripdigits`

Then On, the selected channel names are output without the digits. When Off, the selected channel names are not changed.

#### Align `align`

This menu handles cases where multiple input CHOPs have different start or end times. All channels output from a CHOP share the same start/end interval, so the inputs must be treated with the Align Options:

- **Automatic** `auto` - It will trim to the current [Time Slice] if there are any Time Slices, else it will do an Extend Min/Max.
- **Extend to Min/Max** `none` - Find the earliest start and latest end, and extend all inputs to that range using the extend conditions. (See Extend Conditions).
- **Stretch to Min/Max** `stretch` - Find the earliest start and latest end, and stretch every channel's start and end to that range.
- **Shift to Minimum** `start` - Find the earliest start and shift all channels so they all start at that index. All channels are extended to the length of the longest one.
- **Shift to Maximum** `end` - Find the latest end and shift all channels so they all end at that index. Extend all channels to the length of the longest one.
- **Shift to First Interval** `shift1` - Shift all channels to the start of the first CHOP and sample all inputs using the first input's range.
- **Trim to First Interval** `trim1` - Trim all channels to first CHOP's range.
- **Stretch to First Interval** `stretch1` - Stretch all channels to the first CHOP's range.
- **Trim to Smallest Interval** `trim` - Trim all channels to the smallest start/end interval. The start and end values may not come from the same channel.
- **Stretch to Smallest Interval** `squash` - Stretch all channels to the smallest start/end interval. The start and end values may not come from the same channel.

#### Automatic Prefix `autoprefix`

When 2 channels have the same name, turning on this option will add the node's name (or the node's parent's name, etc.) as a prefix to the channel name. For example, if selecting a channel from /wave1/chan1 and /wave2/chan1, the channels would be renamed chan1 and chan2 if this option is off. Once turned on the channels would be named wave1:chan1 and wave2:chan1.

### Common Page

#### Time Slice `timeslice`

Turning this on forces the channels to be "Time Sliced". A Time Slice is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.

#### Scope `scope`

To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a Scope string on the Common page.

#### Sample Rate Match `srselect`

Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or "Linear" if the Interpolate Options are not available.

- **Resample At First Input's Rate** `first` - Use rate of first input to resample others.
- **Resample At Maximum Rate** `max` - Resample to the highest sample rate.
- **Resample At Minimum Rate** `min` - Resample to the lowest sample rate.
- **Error If Rates Differ** `err` - Doesn't accept conflicting sample rates.

#### Export Method `exportmethod`

This will determine how to connect the CHOP channel to the parameter. Refer to the Export article for more information.

- **DAT Table by Index** `datindex` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the index of the channel in the CHOP.
- **DAT Table by Name** `datname` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the name of the channel in the CHOP.
- **Channel Name is Path:Parameter** `autoname` - The channel is the full destination of where to export to, such has .

#### Export Root `autoexportroot`

This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by Channel Name is Path:Parameter are relative to.

#### Export Table `exporttable`

The DAT used to hold the export information when using the DAT Table Export Methods (See above).
