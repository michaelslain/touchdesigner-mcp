# Leap Motion CHOP

**Family:** CHOP (Channel Operator)

## Summary

The Leap Motion CHOP reads hand, finger, tool and gesture data from the Leap Motion controller. It outputs hand, finger and tool positions, rotations and 'tracking' channels that indicate if these values are currently being detected and updated. Currently only 1 Leap Motion device can be connected at a time.

To connect with the device you will need to install the Ultraleap Tracking Software. For best performance, it is recommended to use the latest version Gemini drivers for Windows (v5.13.2 or greater) or MacOS (v5.14.0 or greater) that are available here: https://developer.leapmotion.com/tracking-software-download. Legacy version 2 or version 4 Orion drivers are also supported. See the API parameter details below for more information.

In addition to installing the driver, TouchDesigner must also be told where to find the tracking library. Installation instructions vary depending on the operating system:

On Windows: You can use the Library Folder parameter to point to the location of the LeapC.dll (Orion/Gemini) or Leap.dll (Version 2/3) files on your system. The file is installed as part of the LeapSDK and the location may vary depending on the version and options selected during installation.

On MacOS: The library folder should point to the location of the Ultraleap tracking app. By default this is '/Applications/Ultraleap Hand Tracking.app' TouchDesigner will automatically find the library files inside the application's contents folder.

> **Tip:** If using Gemini V5, the Leap Motion will only work in one orientation. By default the hands enter from the bottom of the camera view, though this can be changed in setting to invert the direction. This is an important distinction between Gemini V5 and the older V2/V4 APIs which could work in either orientation.

> **Note:** TouchDesigner does not include a license to use the Leap Motion hardware or software. Make sure to check with the UltraLeap website regarding any applicable licenses that you may need for your project.

## Parameters

### Setup Page

#### Active `active`

When 'On' data is captured from the Leap Motion sensor.

#### API `api`

Select between Leap Motion V2 or V4/V5 SDKs for tracking. V5 offers the fastest and most stable tracking, V2 offers some legacy features like gestures.

- **Version 2 Tracking** `default` - Legacy tracking that includes gesture and tool tracking. Download (Windows: Orion Beta 3.2.1, MacOS: 2.3.1)
- **Orion (v4) / Gemini (v5)** `on` - Gemini offers the best performance with improved stability and faster hand recognition to start tracking. Download Gemini (Windows 5.13.2 or greater, MacOS 5.14 or greater) . Legacy version 4 Orion tracking is available on Windows only. Download Orion 4.1.0.

#### Library Folder `libfolder`

This parameter is used on Windows only to point to the location of the library file (.dll) that corresponds to the selected API version.

### Common Page

#### Time Slice `timeslice`

Turning this on forces the channels to be "Time Sliced". A Time Slice is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.

#### Scope `scope`

To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a Scope string on the Common page.

#### Sample Rate Match `srselect`

Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or "Linear" if the Interpolate Options are not available.

- **Resample At First Input's Rate** `first` - Use rate of first input to resample others.
- **Resample At Maximum Rate** `max` - Resample to the highest sample rate.
- **Resample At Minimum Rate** `min` - Resample to the lowest sample rate.
- **Error If Rates Differ** `err` - Doesn't accept conflicting sample rates.

#### Export Method `exportmethod`

This will determine how to connect the CHOP channel to the parameter. Refer to the Export article for more information.

- **DAT Table by Index** `datindex` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the index of the channel in the CHOP.
- **DAT Table by Name** `datname` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the name of the channel in the CHOP.
- **Channel Name is Path:Parameter** `autoname` - The channel is the full destination of where to export to, such has .

#### Export Root `autoexportroot`

This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by Channel Name is Path:Parameter are relative to.

#### Export Table `exporttable`

The DAT used to hold the export information when using the DAT Table Export Methods (See above).
