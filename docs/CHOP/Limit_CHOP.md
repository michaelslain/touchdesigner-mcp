# Limit CHOP

**Family:** CHOP (Channel Operator)

## Summary

The Limit CHOP can limit the values of the input channels to be between a minimum and maximum, and can quantize the input channels in time and/or value such that the value steps over time.

Limiting a channel causes all its values to lie within a range. Several different methods are for limiting are listed under the Type parameter description.

Quantizing a channel value snaps its values to the closest allowable value (the "quantized values"). Quantizing methods are: Floor, Ceiling, and Round.

Quantizing a channel index is like quantizing in time, and acts as a sample and hold mechanism. The channel is sampled at a quantized index, and held at that value until the next quantized index at which time the value takes on the input value at that point.

## Parameters

### Limit Page

#### Type `type`

Select limit options such as loop, clamp, or zigzag from the menu. The value will remain in the range from Min to less than Max.

- **Off** `off` - Do not limit the values.
- **Clamp** `clamp` - Simply cut the channel value off if it is out of the Maximum/Minimum range, and replace it with the Maximum or Minimum limit value.
- **Loop** `loop` - Continue the channel at the other end of the interval.
- **Zigzag** `zigzag` - Mirror the values back inside the interval.

#### Minimum `min`

The minimum value the output channel can have.

#### Maximum `max`

The maximum value the output channel can have.

#### Positive Only `positive`

Takes the absolute value of the channel, making all negative values positive.

#### Normalize `norm`

Scale and offset the channel so that it lies between -1 and +1. The Normalize function does not work with Time Slicing on.

#### Fix Underflows `underflow`

This will cause extremely tiny numbers to be rounded to 0.

### Quantize Page

#### Quantize Value `quantvalue`

Selects the quantization method to use:

- **Off** `off` - No Value quantization is done.
- **Ceiling** `ceiling` - The Ceiling function rounds a value to the closest quantized value above it.
- **Floor** `floor` - The Floor quantization function rounds a value to the closest quantized value below it.
- **Round** `round` - The Round function rounds a value to the nearest quantized value.

#### Value Step `vstep`

The increment between quantized values.

#### Value Offset `voffset`

The offset for quantized values, to allow steps to not lie at zero, the default.

#### Quantize Index `quantindex`

Selects whether to quantize the index relative to the sample 0, or the start index of the CHOP.

- **Off** `off`
- **Offset Relative to Start** `relstart`
- **Offset Relative to Zero** `relzero`

#### Step `istep`

The increment between quantized indices, in seconds, frames or samples.

#### Step Unit `istepunit`

#### Offset `ioffset`

The offset for quantized indices.

#### Offset Unit `ioffsetunit`

### Common Page

#### Time Slice `timeslice`

Turning this on forces the channels to be "Time Sliced". A Time Slice is the time between the last cook frame and the current cook frame.

#### Scope `scope`

To determine which channels get affected, some CHOPs use a Scope string on the Common page. See Pattern Matching.

#### Sample Rate Match `srselect`

Handle cases where multiple input CHOPs' sample rates are different. When Resampling occurs, the curves are interpolated according to the Interpolation Method Option, or "Linear" if the Interpolate Options are not available.

- **Resample At First Input's Rate** `first` - Use rate of first input to resample others.
- **Resample At Maximum Rate** `max` - Resample to the highest sample rate.
- **Resample At Minimum Rate** `min` - Resample to the lowest sample rate.
- **Error If Rates Differ** `err` - Doesn't accept conflicting sample rates.

#### Export Method `exportmethod`

This will determine how to connect the CHOP channel to the parameter. Refer to the Export article for more information.

- **DAT Table by Index** `datindex` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the index of the channel in the CHOP.
- **DAT Table by Name** `datname` - Uses the docked DAT table and references the channel via the name of the channel in the CHOP.
- **Channel Name is Path:Parameter** `autoname` - The channel is the full destination of where to export to, such has .

#### Export Root `autoexportroot`

This path points to the root node where all of the paths that exporting by Channel Name is Path:Parameter are relative to.

#### Export Table `exporttable`

The DAT used to hold the export information when using the DAT Table Export Methods (See above).

#### Rename from `commonrenamefrom`

The channel pattern to rename. See Pattern Matching.

#### Rename to `commonrenameto`

The replacement pattern for the names. The default parameters do not rename the channels. See Pattern Replacement. Example: Channel Names: c[1-10:2] ambient Rename From: c* ambient Rename To: b[1-5] ambThis example fetches channels c1 c3 c5 c7 c9 and ambient. They are then renamed to to b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 and amb.
