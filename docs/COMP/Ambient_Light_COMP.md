# Ambient Light COMP

**Family:** COMP (Component)

## Summary

The Ambient Light Component controls the color and intensity of the environmental light in a given scene. This light, unlike the Light Component, has no particular source. The light it sheds comes from everywhere as opposed to a point light source or focused spotlight.

## Parameters

### Light Page

#### Light Color `c`

You can modify the color of the light three ways: Color List, Hue, Saturation, and Value, or Red, Green, and Blue. To choose one, click on the appropriate box and the color editing fields below change accordingly.

- **Red** `cr`
- **Green** `cg`
- **Blue** `cb`

#### Dimmer `dimmer`

This parameter allows you to change the intensity of the light either as a static value or over time.

### Render Page

#### Material `material`

Selects a MAT to apply to the geometry inside.

#### Render `render`

Whether the Component's geometry is visible in the Render TOP. This parameter works in conjunction (logical AND) with the Component's Render Flag.

#### Draw Priority `drawpriority`

Determines the order in which the Components are drawn. Smaller values get drawn after larger values. The value is compared with other Components in the same parent Component, or if the Component is the top level one listed in the Render TOP's 'Geometry' parameter, then against other top-level Components listed there. This value is most often used to help with Transparency.

#### Pick Priority `pickpriority`

When using a Render Pick CHOP or a Render Pick DAT, there is an option to have a 'Search Area'. If multiple objects are found within the search area, the pick priority can be used to select one object over another. A higher value will get picked over a lower value. This does not affect draw order, or objects that are drawn over each other on the same pixel. Only one will be visible for a pick per pixel.

#### Wireframe Color `wcolor`

Use the R, G, and B fields to set the Component's color when displayed in wireframe shading mode.

- **Red** `wcolorr`
- **Green** `wcolorg`
- **Blue** `wcolorb`

#### Light Mask `lightmask`

By default all lights used in the Render TOP will affect geometry renderer. This parameter can be used to specify a sub-set of lights to be used for this particular geometry. The lights must be listed in the Render TOP as well as this parameter to be used.

### Extensions Page

#### Re-Init Extensions `reinitextensions`

Recompile all extension objects. Normally extension objects are compiled only when they are referenced and their definitions have changed.

#### Init Extensions On Start `initextonstart`

Perform a Re-Init automatically when TouchDEsigner Starts

#### Extension `ext`

Sequence of info for creating extensions on this component

#### Object `ext0object`

A number of class instances that can be attached to the component.

#### Name `ext0name`

Optional name to search by, instead of the instance class name.

#### Promote `ext0promote`

Controls whether or not the extensions are visible directly at the component level, or must be accessed through the .ext member. Example: n.Somefunction vs n.ext.Somefunction

### Common Page

#### Parent Shortcut `parentshortcut`

Specifies a name you can use anywhere inside the component as the path to that component. See Parent Shortcut.

#### Global OP Shortcut `opshortcut`

Specifies a name you can use anywhere at all as the path to that component. See Global OP Shortcut.

#### Internal OP `iop`

Sequence header for internal operators. Shortcut iop0shortcut - Specifies a name you can use anywhere inside the component as a path to "Internal OP" below. See Internal Operators. OP iop0op - The path to the Internal OP inside this component. See Internal Operators.

#### Node View `nodeview`

Determines what is displayed in the node viewer, also known as the Node Viewer. Some options will not be available depending on the Component type (Object Component, Panel Component, Misc.)

- **Default Viewer** `default` - Displays the default viewer for the component type, a 3D Viewer for Object COMPS and a Control Panel Viewer for Panel COMPs.
- **Operator Viewer** `opviewer` - Displays the node viewer from any operator specified in the Operator Viewer parameter below.

#### Operator Viewer `opviewer`

Select which operator's node viewer to use when the Node View parameter above is set to Operator Viewer.

#### Enable Cloning `enablecloning`

Control if the OP should be actively cloneing. Turning this off causes this node to stop cloning it's 'Clone Master'.

#### Enable Cloning Pulse `enablecloningpulse`

Instantaneously clone the contents.

#### Clone Master `clone`

Path to a component used as the Master Clone.

#### Load on Demand `loadondemand`

Loads the component into memory only when required. Good to use for components that are not always used in the project.

#### Enable External .tox `enableexternaltox`

When on (default), the external .tox file will be loaded when the .toe starts and the contents of the COMP will match that of the external .tox. This can be turned off to avoid loading from the referenced external .tox on startup if desired (the contents of the COMP are instead loaded from the .toe file). Useful if you wish to have a COMP reference an external .tox but not always load from it unless you specifically push the Re-Init Network parameter button.

#### Enable External .tox Pulse `enableexternaltoxpulse`

This button will re-load from the external .tox file (if present).

#### External .tox Path `externaltox`

Path to a .tox file on disk which will source the component's contents upon start of a .toe. This allows for components to contain networks that can be updated independently. If the .tox file can not be found, whatever the .toe file was saved with will be loaded.

#### Reload Custom Parameters `reloadcustom`

When this checkbox is enabled, the values of the component's Custom Parameters are reloaded when the .tox is reloaded. This only affects top-level parameters on the component, all parameters on nodes inside the component are always reloaded with the .tox.

#### Reload Built-In Parameters `reloadbuiltin`

When this checkbox is enabled, the values of the component's built-in parameters are reloaded when the .tox is reloaded. This only affects top-level parameters on the component, all parameters on nodes inside the component are always reloaded with the .tox.

#### Save Backup of External `savebackup`

When this checkbox is enabled, a backup copy of the component specified by the External .tox parameter is saved in the .toe file. This backup copy will be used if the External .tox can not be found. This may happen if the .tox was renamed, deleted, or the .toe file is running on another computer that is missing component media.

#### Sub-Component to Load `subcompname`

When loading from an External .tox file, this option allows you to reach into the .tox and pull out a COMP and make that the top-level COMP, ignoring everything else in the file (except for the contents of that COMP). For example if a .tox file named project1.tox contains project1/geo1, putting geo1 as the Sub-Component to Load, will result in geo1 being loaded in place of the current COMP. If this parameter is blank, it just loads the .tox file normally using the top level COMP in the file.

#### Relative File Path Behavior `relpath`

Set whether the child file paths within this COMP are relative to the .toe itself or the .tox, or inherit from parent.

- **Use Parent's Behavior** `inherit` - Inherit setting from parent.
- **Relative to Project File (.toe)** `project` - The path, when specified as a relative path, will be relative to the .toe file.
- **Relative to External COMP File (.tox)** `externaltox` - The path, when specified as a relative path, will be relative to the .tox file. When no external COMP file is specified, or when Enable External .tox is not toggled on, this doesn't have any impact.

#### Parameter Color Space `parmcolorspace`

Controls how all color parameters on this node are interpreted. The color values as treated as being in the selected color space, and are converted to the Working Color Space before they are used as part of the node's operation. Note that this does not change the color space of the node itself, as that is always in the Working Color Space.

- **sRGB** `srgb` - sRGB color space, with sRGB transfer function. Considered an SDR color space with respect to Reference White.
- **sRGB - Linear** `srgblinear` - sRGB color space, with linear transfer function. Considered an SDR color space with respect to Reference White.

- **Rec.709** `rec709` - Rec.709 color space, with Rec.709 (same as Rec.2020) transfer function. Considered an SDR color space with respect to Reference White.
- **Rec.2020** `rec2020` - Rec.2020 color space, with Rec.2020 (same as Rec.709) transfer function. Considered an HDR color space with respect to Reference White.
- **DCI-P3** `dcip3` - DCI-P3 color space, with D65 white point and 2.6 gamma transfer function. Considered an HDR color space with respect to Reference White.

- **Passthrough** `passthrough` - When selected, the color values will be used as-is in the operation, without any modification or attempt to convert them into the Working Color Space.

#### Parameter Reference White `parmreferencewhite`

When converting a parameter color value to the Working Color Space, this controls how it should be treated with respect to Reference White. If the Working Color Space is the same Reference White, then no adjustment is done. If they are different, then the Reference White level (brightness) of this color will be adjusted to the range expected by the Working Color Space. For example if the project is set to have a SDR Reference White of 120 nits, and the HDR Reference White is 80 nits, then a color of (1, 1, 1), which is 120 nits in the SDR color space, will be converted to be (1.5, 1.5, 1.5), which is 120 nits still in the HDR Working Color Space.

- **Default For Color Space** `default` - Will use either the SDR or the HDR Reference White, based on the color space selected.
- **Use Parent Panel** `useparent` - Will use the Reference White that the parent panel has selected. If the top-level panel also has 'Use Parent' selected, then 'UI Reference White' will be used.
- **Standard (SDR)** `sdr` - Will treat the Parameter Color Space as SDR for it's reference white value.
- **High (HDR)** `hdr` - Will treat the Parameter Color Space as HDR for it's reference white value.
- **UI** `ui` - Will treat the Parameter Color Space as UI for it's reference white value. This uses the 'UI Reference White Nits' value for it's brightness.
